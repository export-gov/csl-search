        <p>Panama assesses import duties on an ad valorem basis. The ad valorem system uses the declared CIF value as the basis for import duty calculations and in some cases utilizes historical price information as a reference.</p>

<p>In addition to the duty, all imports into Panama are subject to a 7 percent transfer or value added tax (ITBM) levied on the CIF value, plus import duty and other handling charges. Pharmaceuticals, foods and school supplies are exempt from the ITBM tax.</p>

<p>When the Trade Promotion Agreement between the U.S. and Panama is fully implemented, some 87% of U.S. products will enter Panama duty free. For other products, duties may be phased out over time. Since there are a number of exceptions it is a good idea to check what products fall under the duty free regime. We suggest that U.S. exporters go through the following process to determine duties today and in the future:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://export.customsinfo.com/">Customs Info Database</a> - shows you tariffs/duties that Panama is currently assessing. You can access this database by simply signing up with your email address. Note: Panama already allows duty-free imports for certain projects, e.g. Canal expansion or Metro construction. Please <a href="http://export.gov/panama/contactus/index.asp">contact us</a> for more information on these exceptions.</li>
<li><a href="http://export.gov/fta/ftatarifftool/ftamain.aspx">Tariff Tool for Free Trade Agreements</a> – shows you how tariffs will be phased out for any particular good in any country that has a Free Trade Agreement (current or pending) with the U.S. <em><strong>Cautionary note:</strong></em> this tool does not show agricultural products. In addition, it is not completely accurate for current tariff rates; instead, it shows what Panama is allowed to charge, which may be higher.</li>
</ol>


<p>Beginning in 1995, Panama adopted the Harmonized System (HS) or Tariff Nomenclature as its customs classification system.</p>

<p>In general, the Panamanian customs system does not represent a significant obstacle for U.S. exporters.</p>
