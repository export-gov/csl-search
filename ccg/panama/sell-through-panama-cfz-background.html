        <p>Panama has long been known for being a transit point for goods, most recently through the Panam a Canal. Although the percentage of world trade that passes through the Panama Canal has diminished to 5% in recent years, the Canal continues to play a key role in regional trade. We believe that the CFZ will grow dramatically with the successful expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014.</p>

<p>Here is why – in the next couple of years, the majority of container capacity will be on vessels that are too large to transit the Canal currently – so-called Post-Panamax ships. But with the expansion of the Canal, vessels up to 12,000 TEUs – all but a very small percentage of super-Post Panamax ships – will suddenly have a new option for all-water transit through the Canal from Asia to markets in North America, Latin America, and Europe. As a result, ports in the region are investing heavily in deep water capacity and transshipment capabilities.</p>

<p>For this reason, we believe that the increased traffic through the Canal, primarily from the Pacific to the Atlantic, will result in greater transshipment activity. Why? Because most ports in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean will not be able to accommodate vessels that are 6,000 + TEUs. So once their cargo transits the Canal, there is an opportunity to break the containers down and redistribute them via smaller vessels throughout the region. And the CFZ is collocated with the premier transshipment ports in the region.</p>
