        <p>As the world economy recovers from the global crisis and the Canal expansion is completed, Panamanian ports will continue showing a strong growth. This will generate increased business opportunities for port-related activities, including port equipment, dredges, consulting services, and fuel supplies.</p>

<p>When completed, the expansion of the Panama Canal will allow all-water routes for container ships carrying up to 12,500 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). Currently the largest container vessels that can pass through – referred to as Panamax – carry 5,000 TEUs. A number of analysts believe that the expanded Canal will increase transshipment activity dramatically. And in response to this prospect, the ports in Panama are investing heavily in dredging as well as purchasing such equipment as larger cranes.</p>
