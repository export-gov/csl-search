We can help you work through whether or not the CFZ represents a good opportunity to explore. If we think you do, we’ll encourage you to fly down to Panama and we’ll take you to Colon (about 50 miles away from Panama City) to look at the CFZ, meet with key merchants, and make a pitch if you’re inclined to. We’ll assist with a driver, interpreter, car, and of course the qualified meetings with the best merchants in CFZ.</p>
