        <p><strong>If you sell to a country that has high interest rates and you demand cash in advance or a letter of credit from your buyer, you will likely sell less and may even lose the sale to a competitor who is willing to provide better payment terms.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Simply put, when a company, any company, is faced with high interest rates, they will do everything they can to avoid borrowing money. This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buying less.</li>
<li>Not buying at all.</li>
<li>Paying more to buy on open account terms.</li>
<li>Buying inferior product if it is being sold on open account terms.</li>
</ol>


<p>The following example highlights what many Latin American Companies face when trying to decide what and how much to import:</p>

<p><em>Imagine that you are a buyer in Latin America and you want to purchase $100,000 worth of widgets from a US exporter to stock your warehouse. It will take approximately 30 days for the widgets to arrive and then it will take another 90 days to sell the widgets. In addition, your local client will demand 90 days to pay you. In total, then, you will only be paid for the product you purchased from your US supplier 7 months (210 days) after you purchased it.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>In Brazil, if you took a line of credit where interest rates are approximately 2.2% per month, you will pay your bank $16,454 in interest (compounded monthly).</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>In Mexico, if you took a line of credit where interest rates are approximately 1.1% per month, you will pay your bank $6,784 in interest (compounded monthly).</em></p></li>
</ul>
