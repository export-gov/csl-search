        <p>The expansion of the Panama Canal, a $5.25 billion project, will bring excellent opportunities for U.S. exporters of auto and truck parts. In addition, the Government of Panama started in early 2011 to replace the entire bus fleet serving Panama City. Since the new bus system will replace over 1,500 poorly maintained buses currently on the road, we expect a step order increase in maintenance and parts demands. In addition, the Government has imposed new regulations on the taxi service, which may lead to an increase in demand for maintenance as well.</p>
