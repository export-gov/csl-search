        <p><strong>The second main variation of Export Finance is whether or not a credit guarantee is used by the lending bank to provide it with security against the risk of non-payment</strong> by either the US Exporter (in the case of Supplier Credit) or the Foreign Buyer (in the case of Buyer Credit). Credit Guarantees are frequently provided to US Banks by U.S. Ex-Im Bank or other credit insurers, as outlined in the section on Export Credit Insurance.</p>

<p>The following four diagrams highlight both simple Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit without an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee and Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Due to the fact that loan costs increase when the lending bank uses a Guarantee the total loan cost increases accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Comments / Additional Information:</strong></p>

<p>In general export financing of sales to buyers in most Latin American countries contain a 6-month grace period after which the buyer/supplier must begin repaying the bank.</p>

<p>The costs (premium) associated with a US Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or that of another credit insurer) range from approximately 1.5% and 2% per year in addition to the cost of funding from the commercial bank. Premium can fluctuate dramatically based on the perceived risk of a given buyer. In other words, the weaker the borrower, the more expensive the premium.</p>

<p>Due to the added complexity and additional work required to arrange the transaction, the finance cost generally increases more than the simple cost of the Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Banks interviewed indicated that Export Finance for US exports to Latin America with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee generally cost as follows and depends on the amount financed.</p>
