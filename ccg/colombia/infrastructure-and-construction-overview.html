        <p>A constant complaint among Colombian companies is that bringing merchandise to Bogota or Medellin from the port of Buenaventura is more expensive than shipping goods from that same port all the way to Asia. According to the “Infrastructura de Transporte en Colombia” study, Colombia has the highest internal costs for container transportation in all of Latin America. It costs (on average) a whopping US$1,808 to move a container in Colombia vs. US$925 in Mexico or US$280 in Peru10. These high transportation costs are often jokingly referred to as a “national tax”, and they result in an additional cost to the end user. Historically, in addition to Colombia’s challenging geography with its three mountains ranges dividing the country, the main forces behind the nation’s inadequate infrastructure network have been corruption, militancy and shifting government agendas over the years.</p>

<p>In 2010, Colombia had just 236 miles of paved roads per 1 million inhabitants, compared to 1,002 in Argentina, 851 in Venezuela, and 560 in Peru. Only 20 percent of Colombia's roads are paved, and the nation has just 1,200 kilometers of dual-lane divided highways. These figures go a long way toward explaining why out of 144 countries, Colombia ranks 126th in quality of roads, well behind Chile (23) and Peru (100).</p>

<p>Regarding other modes of transportation, Colombia has 900 kilometers of railroad, and a centrally located river, the Magdalena, that has yet to be developed to transport goods on a large-scale, though the government of Colombia (GOC) has plans to develop it in the coming years. Colombia also has airports in all of its principal cities, with many expected to be renovated and expanded in the coming years. Passenger air travel in Colombia has increased 15 percent over the last year, and is ranked 19th in the world ahead of countries such as Argentina or Chile. Colombians are accustomed to traveling by air between cities, as the poor roads and tough topography make driving a much less appealing alternative. Car rides between Colombia’s principal cities take between 7 and 24 hours by car, but just 30-90 minutes by plane.</p>

<p>Taking all of these factors into consideration, the GOC has created an ambitious program to update the country´s infrastructure in the next 6 years with investments of more than US$24 billion. This program involves not only road projects, but railways, airports, waterways and ocean ports, all of which present significant opportunities for American firms.</p>

<p>In order to gain time from the lost years of investment, the GOC has created the 4th Generation Public Private Partnership (4G PPP) law that allows international companies to invest through build-operate-transfer 30 year concessions that will expand infrastructure investment to levels not seen in Colombia since the 1950s. The GOC has plans to increase spending on national infrastructure projects from one to three percent of GDP over the next few years. This is an increase from the current investments of</p>

<p>US$3 billion per year to US$9 billion. New 4G concession opportunities are valued at over US$24 billion.</p>

<p>On September 18, 2012, Colombia’s National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) launched a new generation of transportation infrastructure concessions. ANI will award more than US$24 billion worth of concessions by the first quarter of 2014, involving more than 40 projects in total covering road, rail, ports, and airports.</p>

<p>Most of the road projects are designed for the expansion of the country’s road transport system which includes more than 30 primary road improvements and construction projects. Many planned concession projects (such as the Prosperity Corridor and the Sun Route) will link the main ports with major cities to improve the current state of cargo transportation and to lessen the perceived “tax” on goods shipped over land.</p>

<p>The GOC is planning concessions for rehabilitating and upgrading railroads and increasing the movement of cargo by rail from the current 35m tons to 90m tons by 2018. In order to meet the previously mentioned goals close to 1,500 miles will need to be built. The main project is the Western Railway, which will join the city of Cali with the Buenaventura port.</p>

<p>ANI has also launched the recuperation of navigability of the Magdalena River (over US$1 billion investment) to make it capable of transporting coal and oil, which should lower transportation costs from the heart of the country to Barranquilla on the Caribbean Coast.</p>

<p>Even though airport projects are a lower priority, there are significant projects on hand, especially for the modernization and expansion of over 25 national and small regional airports. A notable achievement was the inauguration of Bogota’s El Dorado terminal, the third busiest hub in Latin America after Sao Paulo and Mexico City. New projects involve bidding rounds (US$150m) for the modification and expansion of the Barranquilla Airport. Similar concessions are in place for the smaller airports of Armenia, Popayan and Cartago. Meanwhile, the Cali Airport will be undergoing the construction of a new international terminal with a project value of over US$75 million.</p>

<p>Regarding sea port projects, the most important initiative involves the expansion of cargo patios in order to enlarge the container areas which are already saturated. Among current projects are a US$250 million project for Buenaventura, a US$180 million project for Barranquilla, and a US$100 million project for Santa Marta.</p>

<p>While the urban transport projects of Bogota are not part of the 4G concessions, the Bogota Metro subway project has recently begun, and contracts for design and studies have been signed. The system is set to have 28 stations connecting 26 kilometers of subway lines, with an estimated cost of US$2.5 billion. The optimistic completion date of the first line is set to be in 2020.</p>

<p>The execution of the projects mentioned above involve both private and public financing efforts. Opportunities exist for American banks that may be interested in supporting some of these projects, especially those under 4G PPP contracts.</p>
