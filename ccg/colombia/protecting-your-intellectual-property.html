        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Several general principles are important for effective management of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Colombia. First, it is important to have an overall strategy to protect IPR. Second, IPR is protected differently in Colombia than in the United States. Third, rights must be registered and enforced in Colombia, under local laws. Companies may wish to seek advice from local attorneys or IPR consultants. The U.S. Commercial Service can provide a list of local lawyers upon request.</p>

<p>It is vital that companies understand that intellectual property is primarily a private right and that the U.S. government generally cannot enforce rights for private individuals in Colombia. It is the responsibility of the rights' holders to register, protect, and enforce their rights where relevant, retaining their own counsel and advisors.</p>

<p>While the U.S. government is willing to assist, there is little it can do if the rights holders have not taken these fundamental steps necessary to securing and enforcing their IPR in a timely fashion. Moreover, in many countries, rights holders who delay enforcing their rights on a mistaken belief that the U.S. government can provide a political resolution to a legal problem may find that their rights have been eroded or abrogated due to doctrines such as statutes of limitations, or unreasonable delay in prosecuting a</p>

<p>law suit. In no instance should U.S. government advice be seen as a substitute for the obligation of a rights holder to promptly pursue its case.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on partners. U.S. companies should consider the business objections and compliance history of the partner to protect and honor IPR requirements. Additionally, companies should give their Colombian partners clear incentives to honor the contract. A good partner is an important ally in protecting IPR. Keep an eye on your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of would-be bad actors. Projects and sales in Colombia require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Colombian laws to create a solid contract that includes non-competition clauses, and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that small and medium-size companies understand the importance of working together with trade associations and organizations to support efforts to protect IPR and stop counterfeiting. There are a number of these organizations, based in Colombia and the United States. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and local American Chambers of Commerce</p></li>
<li><p>National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)</p></li>
<li><p>International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA)</p></li>
<li><p>International Trademark Association (INTA)</p></li>
<li><p>The Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy</p></li>
<li><p>International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC)</p></li>
<li><p>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)</p></li>
<li><p>Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO)</p></li>
<li><p>Superintendence of Industry and Commerce</p></li>
<li><p>Ministry of the Interior and of Justice, Special Administrative Department,</p></li>
<li><p>National Copyright Directorate</p></li>
<li><p>The Business Software Alliance (BSA)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IPR Climate in Colombia</strong></p>

<p>In Colombia, regulations for the protection of IPR are in place. However, U.S. companies have concerns related to their enforcement. Particularly, companies in the pharmaceutical, music recording, computer, electronics, and software industries have encountered widespread piracy and counterfeiting of their products over many years.</p>

<p>Software protection is an especially difficult area for enforcement. Estimates indicate that the piracy level may be above 50 percent, and trade losses due to software piracy are calculated at around US $ 136 million. However, the government has been stepping up efforts in recent years, in order to tackle the problem, and thus defend legal manufacturers.</p>

<p>Such efforts have helped to somewhat reduce the piracy level in Colombia and maintain the ranking of the country among those with the lowest piracy rates in the region. U.S. companies operating in Colombia have acknowledged such efforts. However, Colombia remains on the Special 301 Watch List.</p>

<p>Colombia, a WTO member, has ratified legislation to implement its obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Colombia is also a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Treaty on the International Registration of Audiovisual Works, and the 1978 Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties, and a signatory to the Patent Cooperation Treaty.</p>

<p>Colombia has also addressed bilateral IPR issues in the FTAFTA. However, even though Colombia may be able to regulate the issue, the problem of enforcement persists.</p>

<p>The regulatory system itself may not be the ideal structure in order to act in a coordinated manner to tackle the problem. On the one hand, the registration and administration of IPR are carried out by four different government entities. The Superintendent for Industry and Commerce (SIC) acts as the Colombian patent and trademark office. This agency also acts as the IPR policy developer.</p>

<p>The Colombian Agricultural Institute (Instituto Colombiano de Agricultura - ICA) is in charge of the issuance of plant variety protection-related and agro-chemical patents. The Ministry of Social Protection is in charge of the issuance of pharmaceutical patents, while the Ministry of Justice is in charge of the issuance of literary copyrights. Each of these entities suffers from significant financial and technical resource constraints.</p>

<p>Enforcement is carried out by another series of agencies including: the Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN), the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office, the National Police, and the Judiciary. Officials within these agencies often do not have a good understanding of IPR issues and of the severity of the offenses committed.</p>

<p>Periodically, the Economic Section recommends candidates for U.S. PTO training in Washington, DC.</p>
