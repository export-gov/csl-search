        <p>Opportunities for U.S. companies in the Colombian IT market are associated to three main drivers: 1) increased connectivity and affordability of equipment; 2) multi-sector economic growth; and 3) government programs for institutional, regional and SME modernization.</p>

<p>Nationwide improvements in infrastructure along with increased connectivity for the general population and for business associated with the successful implementation of Vive Digital are expected to impact the supply and demand of IT hardware and software in a positive way. In particular, MinTIC will try to foster content development and industry-specific applications that can take advantage of the infrastructure deployed over the last four years.</p>

<p>Household demand for Internet -ready computers and mobile devices, such as tablets and ultra-books, is expected to increase due in part to improved infrastructure, but also</p>

<p>due to decreases in the cost of computing equipment derived from key tax and customs reforms.</p>

<p>By the end of 2012 Colombia could boast that IT equipment in the country was the most affordable in the region, stirring up competition as lower prices lead to increased demand from a growing middle class that can now purchase previously inaccessible goods.</p>

<p>With 4G/LTE services rolling out in 2014, demand for equipment capable of taking advantage of this new technology should also benefit.</p>

<p>A second major source of opportunities for U.S. companies in Colombia relates to sustained demand for IT hardware and services, expected from the ever growing number of new and expanding companies operating in the country’s dynamically growing sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>As Colombia’s security situation has improved over the last 10 years, so have the flows of Foreign Direct Investment into the country, with oil, energy and mining being sectors with intense activity and potential for continued growth. As major national and international companies such as Ecopetrol, Cerrejón, ISA, Chevron, Pacific Rubiales, BHP Billiton, and AngloGold Ashanti continue to expand their operations in Colombia, U.S. IT companies with experience and specific value-propositions tailored for these sectors could benefit greatly.</p>

<p>Other sectors with a natural demand for IT hardware and services, where growth in IT investment or refreshment cycles are expected to take place, include Business Process Outsourcing, Financial Services, Transportation and Aviation, and Retailing.</p>

<p>BPOs continue to be a big bet by policymakers at the national and local level, with Medellin, Barranquilla and Bogota positioned to continue attracting local and foreign investment into the sector. Local banks are expanding throughout the region, with some regional banks and specialized financial institutions deploying operations in Colombia.</p>

<p>Colombia’s international trade is expected to continue growing at a fast pace, as the multitude of Free Trade Agreements signed by the country enter into force. This will drive up demand for transportation and aviation services, as local goods enter new markets, and foreign goods and brands enter or expand throughout Colombia, which in turn will benefit consumer retail at the local level.</p>

<p>Dynamic economic activity in these sectors should prove a boon for U.S. IT companies capable of adding value to new and existing companies operating in Colombia, both foreign and domestic. Services such as Cloud Computing and Virtualization are likely to be of interest both for large multinationals seeking to reduce IT costs, as well as for SMEs looking to build computing capacity without incurring considerable expenditures.</p>

<p>Specific opportunities may also be found in these sectors for companies seeking more sophistication in terms of IT architecture and applications. For example, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Solutions and Supply Chain Management Systems (SCMS) should be of particular interest to companies operating in manufacturing, logistics, transportation, aviation and trade. Business Intelligence Solutions and Advanced</p>

<p>Security Software Solutions should also be of interest for retailing and financial services companies.</p>
