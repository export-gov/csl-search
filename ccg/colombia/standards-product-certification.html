        <p>Manufacturers and importers of products regulated by official mandatory technical standards or technical regulations need to register themselves in SIC’s Mandatory Registry prior to selling products in Colombia. Products can be tested in accredited laboratories to obtain the certificate of conformity and SIC accepts certificates issued by accredited certification entities, such as members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) multilateral agreement.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism eliminated the mandatory status for the majority of products previously covered. SIC is working with other government agencies to develop technical regulations for products that present threats to health, safety, environment, or national security. Under WTO commitments, the Colombian government must submit draft technical regulations for comment prior to the new regulation’s entry into force.</p>
