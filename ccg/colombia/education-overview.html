        <p>U.S. colleges and universities remain the preferred overseas destination for Colombian students, despite significant competition from other countries like the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Argentina. There are several reasons that make the United States a leading destination, chief among them higher employment opportunities after graduation, the chance to improve English skills, and the high quality of education. The preferred states for Colombian students are California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida.</p>
