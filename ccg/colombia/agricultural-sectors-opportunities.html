        <p>U.S. food companies looking to break into the Colombian market for consumer oriented food products and beverages should consider visiting Colombia to conduct a preliminary market analysis and meet potential buyers. Implementation of the FTA provided increased opportunities for U.S. food and beverages and it is critical to develop business relationships with Colombian counterparts.
