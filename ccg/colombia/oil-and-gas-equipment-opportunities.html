        <p>Potential opportunities involve petrochemical and refinery expansion projects, including an expansion of the Barrancabermeja refinery which awarded Foster Wheeler USA and Process Consultants the project management contract and expects to open the selection process for the US$2.5 billion EPC contract.</p>

<p>Other large projects include the construction of the US$4.2 billion Oleoducto del Bicentenario, a 960 kilometer crude pipeline (450,000 barrels per day) that is expected to become operational by the end of 2014. Ecopetrol has a 55 percent share of this project. Other partners include a 32.8 percent share held by Pacific Rubiales, and the remaining 12.2 percent held by other firms including PetroMinerales and Hocol.</p>
