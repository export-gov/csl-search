        <p>In addition to the benefits of manufacturing “tablets” in Brazil, since 2007 the GOB’s Ministry of Education has been investing in PROINFO, a program to promote technology as an important classroom teaching tool. The program includes installations of technology labs in the public schools, laptops for teachers and students, digital boards, projectors and tablets. The budget also allows for teacher training. In 2013, the GOB will continue to invest in the program.</p>

<p>Brazil is considered the fifth largest personal computer market in the world, driving Latin America’s PC market with a 41.5% share. Brazil is forecasted to continue experiencing the largest growth rate in this region, through 2014.</p>

<p>Brazil's trade policy has clearly favored domestic production of PCs over the importation of complete systems. Tariffs for complete PC systems remain high, and despite policy changes, the trend will likely continue, compelling foreign vendors to establish manufacturing facilities within Brazil. GOB policy also stipulates PC manufacturers need to maintain a minimum ratio of 3% locally-driven R&amp;D investment compared to revenue. This encourages domestic manufacturers to innovate and remain competitive against foreign products.</p>

<p>A challenge for foreign companies will be the “Lei de Preferência” (Law of Preference – Decree 7.903/2013) that gives 25% of advantage to locally produced products when participating in public bids.</p>
