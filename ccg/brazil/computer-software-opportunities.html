        <p>The majority of computer distributors in Brazil are national companies, but in recent years foreign distributors have entered the market, joining Brazilian dealers/re-sellers to become more competitive.</p>

<p>A strong financial partner is important for computer hardware/software distributors in Brazil; therefore, a number of Brazilian distributors are collaborating with banking partners to solidify their financial position. The increased financial resources of these distributors allow them to offer better financing and improved payment terms to their re-sellers. In Brazil, due to high interest rates on loans, this ability is a distinct competitive advantage.</p>

<p>As the number of resellers, value-added resellers (VARs), and agents grow and their portfolios expand, more distributors will adhere to the two-tier distribution model. Below is a description of the one and two-tier distribution models that operate in Brazil.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution Models</strong></p>

<p>Under the one-tier distribution model, the supplier delivers the product to the end-user via agents, VARs, and systems integrators. The supplier does not rely on a distributor to supply re-sellers, who are in direct contact with the end-users. In special cases, the supplier may sell directly to the end-user.</p>

<p>The two-tier distribution model is the same as the one-tier model, but with an additional intermediary. Here, the supplier provides the product to the distributor, who then passes the product to an intermediary distribution channel such as a VAR, agent or systems integrator; each of whom has access to end-users.</p>

<p>In August 2012, the Government of Brazil (GOB) launched the “TI Maior” project (“Greater IT”) in which the government will invest R$500 million (US$227 million) in innovation, in-country software development and information technology by 2015. Of this amount, R$40 million (US$18 million) will be devoted to “start-ups”.</p>

<p>A challenge for U.S. companies is the “Lei de Preferência” (Law of Preference; Decree 7.174) that gives a cost preference of up to 25% to locally developed solutions when participating in public procurement bids. Developers of software must undergo a certification process in order to prove the local content of their solutions.</p>

<p>Server virtualization, which is already a reality in medium and large enterprises, will continue growing in 2014. In order to absorb a volume of data that is growing at a rate of 30% per year, the proliferation of virtual machines, and the increased use of new applications such as CRM and business intelligence, Brazilian companies will invest heavily in memory and storage solutions.</p>

<p>The increase in data traffic arising from the expansion of virtualization and the use of mobile devices in corporate networks will positively impact the market for switches and wireless LAN networks. The security of mobile devices will also become a priority. IT vendors could seize opportunities created by the World Cup and Olympic Games, especially for software related to command &amp; control centers and intelligent transportation solutions.</p>
