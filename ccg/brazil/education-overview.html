        <p>The education sector in Brazil is ranked as the 10th largest sector in the economy, and generates about US$75 billion per year. Brazil has 51 million students in the basic education system (which includes pre-school, elementary and high school), and around 6 million students are enrolled in university courses. Approximately 75% of graduate students go to private institutions, generating US$12.5 billion per year. In 2015, 10 million students will be in universities, many of whom will be supported by Federal Government loans. With the Government of Brazil (GOB)’s “FIES” loans, students finance up to 100% of their education, while with “PROUNI” loans, public school students finance up to 50%.</p>

<p>The education sector is one of President Rousseff’s highest priorities. Brazil, a vast country with continental dimensions, faces many challenges and needs to deliver a high standard of education for its population so that the country can continue on its growth trajectory. For that reason, the GOB is investing in a wide range of educational programs.</p>

<p>The government's Scientific Mobility Program (formerly called “Science without Borders”), will provide 101,000 scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students from Brazil for one year of study at colleges and universities in the United States and other foreign countries. The program’s specific focus is on promoting scientific research, increasing international cooperation in science and technology and initiating and engaging students in a global dialogue through international education.</p>

<p>The education sector has grown exponentially in recent years in Brazil, and industry specialists project that growth will continue in the coming years, driven by a stabilizing economy and the growing middle class. In the past five years, 26.1 million Brazilians have risen from poverty and this newly emerging class is eager for training, higher education, and vocational courses.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education’s budget for 2013 is 5.5% of Brazil’s GDP, or US$19 billion. The Ministry seeks to invest heavily in classroom infrastructure, learning technologies, textbooks, and other programs.</p>

<p>Beyond government purchases, the education sector in Brazil (including school supplies, materials and other goods and services related to education) is a US$4 billion industry, wherein lies many opportunities for U.S. companies. School materials comprise 44% of the total value of the education industry in Brazil. University books comprise 18%, basic education books 20%, and alternative educational systems 9%. Franchises for language schools comprise an additional 9%.</p>

<p>Studying abroad has become more attractive to Brazilian students, due to the number of students in universities and the favorable economy, as well as the Scientific Mobility Program described above. Brazil ranks 14th in the world as country of origin for foreign students who are studying at U.S. universities. According to a report by the Institute of International Education (IIE), 9,029 Brazilian students studied in the U.S. in 2012, a 6% increase from 2011.</p>

<p>The consensus is that these numbers will continue to increase over the next few years, due to the Scientific Mobility Program, which was created in 2010 by President Rouseff. By the end of 2012, 22,600 scholarships had been awarded to Brazilians, the majority of whom study in the U.S. Twenty-two percent of all Scientific Mobility students (almost 5,000) were placed in 238 U.S. universities. Most of these students (58%) are attending undergraduate courses.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Government has partnered with IIE to administer the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program for U.S. educational institutions. Accredited American colleges and universities interested in hosting students through the program should register with IIE at: <a href="http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility">http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility</a>.</p>
