        <p>Imports to Brazil are primarily handled using traditional letters of credit (L/C) or collections through established banks with correspondent banking agreements overseas. To a lesser extent, U.S. exporters may choose to operate on an open account or cash in advance basis once they have established a trustworthy relationship with their Brazilian buyers. (Note: given high interest rates and intermediary spreads, Brazilian buyers are likely to push for an open account or cash up front. We highly recommend that U.S. companies work with Ex-Im Bank insurance or guarantees to ensure payment).</p>

<p><strong>Credit and Collection</strong></p>

<p>Credit information on Brazilian companies is available for a fee from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (<a href="http://www.dnb.com.br">http://www.dnb.com.br</a>), Equifax (<a href="http://www.equifax.com.br">http://www.equifax.com.br</a>) or SERASA, a Brazilian commercial information service company (<a href="http://www.serasaexperian.com.br">http://www.serasaexperian.com.br</a>) (SERASA recently merged with the Irish firm EXPERIAN, which has a strong presence in the U.S.). In the event of a commercial dispute or non-payment by a Brazilian importer requiring legal action, the U.S. exporter should contact a reputable legal firm with experience in international collections. Local collection agencies do not handle international disputes. The U.S. Commercial Service in Brazil can furnish lists of law firms through our Customized Contact List (CCL) or International Partner Search (IPS) services.</p>
