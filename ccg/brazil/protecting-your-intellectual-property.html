        <p>Several general principles are important for effective management of intellectual property (“IP”) rights in Brazil. First, it is important to have an overall strategy to protect your IP. Second, IP is protected differently in Brazil than in the U.S. Third, rights must be registered and enforced in Brazil, under local laws. Your U.S. trademark and patent registrations will not protect you in Brazil. There is no such thing as an “international copyright” that will automatically protect an author’s writings throughout the entire world. Protection against unauthorized use in a particular country depends, basically, on the national laws of that country. However, most countries do offer copyright protection to foreign works under certain conditions, and these conditions have been greatly simplified by international copyright treaties and conventions.</p>

<p>Registration of patents and trademarks is on a first-in-time, first-in-right basis, so you should consider applying for trademark and patent protection even before selling your products or services in the Brazilian market. It is vital that companies understand that intellectual property is primarily a private right and that the US government generally cannot enforce rights for private individuals in Brazil. It is the responsibility of the rights' holders to register, protect, and enforce their rights where relevant, retaining their own counsel and advisors. Companies may wish to seek advice from local attorneys or IP consultants who are experts in Brazilian law. The U.S. Commercial Service in Brazil can provide a list of local lawyers upon request.</p>

<p>While the U.S. Government stands ready to assist, there is little we can do if the rights holders have not taken such fundamental steps necessary to securing and enforcing their IP in a timely fashion. Moreover, in many countries, rights holders who delay enforcing their rights with the mistaken belief that the USG can provide a political resolution to a legal problem may find that their rights have been eroded or abrogated due to legal doctrines such as statutes of limitations, laches, estoppel, or unreasonable delay in prosecuting a law suit. In no instance should U.S. Government advice be seen as a substitute for the obligation of a rights holder to promptly pursue its case.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on potential partners. Negotiate from the position of your partner and give your partner clear incentives to honor the contract. A good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Consider carefully, however, whether to permit your partner to register your IP rights on your behalf. Doing so may create a risk that your partner will list itself as the IP owner and fail to transfer the rights should the partnership end. Keep an eye on your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of such would-be bad actors””. Projects and sales in Brazil require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Brazil laws to create a solid contract that includes non-compete clauses, and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that small and medium-size companies understand the importance of working together with trade associations and organizations to support efforts to protect IP and stop counterfeiting. There are a number of these organizations, both Brazil- and U.S.-based. These include:</p>
