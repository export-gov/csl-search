        <p>Joint ventures are common in Brazil, particularly as an approach for foreign firms to compete for government contracts or in heavily regulated industries, such as telecommunications and energy. Usually, joint ventures are established through <em>"sociedades anônimas"</em> or <em>"limitadas,"</em> which are similar to corporations and limited partnerships, respectively. Licensing agreements are also common in Brazil. For more information see Chapter 6 “Investment Climate” section. All licensing and technical assistance agreements, including trademark licenses, must be registered with the Brazilian Industrial Property Institute (INPI).</p>
