        <p>It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on potential partners. Negotiate from the position of your partner and give your partner clear incentives to honor the contract. As stated in the previous section, a good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Consider carefully, however, whether to permit your partner to register your IP rights on your behalf. Doing so may create a risk that your partner will list itself as the IP owner and fail to transfer the rights should the partnership end.</p>

<p>Closely monitor your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of potential bad actors. Projects and sales in Brazil require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Brazilian laws to create a solid contract that includes non-compete clauses and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions.</p>

<p>In Brazil, the U.S. Commercial Service (USCS) can provide U.S. companies with lists of well-known and respected credit rating companies and law firms that can conduct credit checks on potential customers or provide important legal advice. Additionally, the USCS Brazil offers U.S. companies detailed background information, including visits to the target company, through its International Company Profile (ICP). For information on this product, please go to our Services for U.S. Companies at <a href="http://export.gov/Brazil/">http://export.gov/Brazil/</a>.</p>
