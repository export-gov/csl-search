        <p>The federal government has granted tax benefits for certain free trade zones. Most of these free trade zones aim to attract investment to the country’s relatively underdeveloped North and Northeast regions. The most prominent of these is the Manaus Free Trade Zone, in Amazonas State, which has attracted significant foreign investment, including from U.S. companies. In October 2011, President Rousseff signed a constitutional amendment which extends Manaus’s status as an industrial zone for another 50 years. This measure must be approved by the Congress, however, and has yet to enter into force as of the end of 2013.</p>
