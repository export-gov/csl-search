        <p>Brazil is experiencing major growth in the ACE industry. The country has captured global attention as its major cities undergo a construction boom related to the 2014 World Cup and, specifically for Rio de Janeiro, the Summer Olympic Games in 2016.</p>

<p>The Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro estimates that investments in the State between 2010 and 2016 will reach US$ 50 billion, in sectors including infrastructure, construction, transportation and others. Most of these investments will be done under Brazil’s Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).</p>

<p>Architectural design and engineering projects around the country, from roads and stadiums to airports and retail space, are abundant. Although there is strong competition from local firms, U.S. ACE firms with niche expertise are welcome to do business in Brazil, provided they understand the regulatory procedures for being able to work in Brazil.</p>

<p>More details can be found in the report titled “Opportunities for U.S. Architectural &amp; Engineering Design Services in Brazil”, which can be found at: <a href="http://buyusainfo.net/docs/x_6001335.pdf">http://buyusainfo.net/docs/x_6001335.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>

<p>In order for U.S. ACE companies to do business in Brazil, there are two general options. The first is for a U.S. company to partner with a local firm that is licensed to provide architectural/engineering services in Brazil. As with most services imported to Brazil, the Brazilian firm using the service will have to pay additional costs of up to 40% of the price of the services rendered. To avoid this process, a U.S. firm may prefer to set up a business in Brazil directly and obtain the license to provide such services in Brazil. This option works for U.S. firms looking to do business in Brazil over the long-term, as starting a business in Brazil and obtaining the necessary approvals to do architectural or engineering work is not a short-term process.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC), Brazilian authorities have significantly reduced the amount of time required to grant various licenses and registrations over the past few years. Having service providers such as lawyers, customs brokers and accounting firms is essential to understand how the business environment works. They can assist once a company has chosen which method of market entry works best, such as opening a subsidiary or establishing a joint-venture partnership.</p>
