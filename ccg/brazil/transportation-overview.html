        <p>Brazilian transportation infrastructure faces many challenges. Roads and ports need to be upgraded. Trucks hauling cargo on roads are the most used method of transportation. Despite the existence of several rivers, waterways are rarely used, except in the Amazon region, where rivers are usually the only way to access many isolated points. Railroads are few and uncompetitive. The use of trains for long distance transportation of passengers is restricted to a few urban tourist routes, while cargo transportation is mostly restricted to raw minerals.</p>

<p>According to the Government of Brazilian (GOB), investments needed to reduce bottlenecks in the transportation sector in the medium and long term will total US$220 billion between 2008 and 2023. Investments include extension of highways, the interconnection of the North-South regions with the Southeast region, ferries to cover North-South regions, and port construction.</p>

<p>Major international sporting events including the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics have spurred Brazil to act quickly to improve its transportation infrastructure. The government is developing new concessions and public-private partnerships, leveraging the private sector in a way that is mutually beneficial to investors and the government.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2013, President Rousseff launched the Logistics Investment Program, an initiative designed on the basis of strategic partnerships with the private sector and focused on renewal and integration of Brazilâ€™s transportation network. The goal is to meet growth demands of a country with continental dimensions. The Logistics Investment Program consists of a wide concession set in transportation logistics, which implies large private investment in infrastructure. Since 2013, the GOB has been staging concession auctions for large projects such as highways (7,500 km), railways (10,000 km) and ports.</p>
