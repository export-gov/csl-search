        <p>The best means of entering the Brazilian market is by a tiered distribution channel agreement with a local established partner. Trade fairs are an excellent opportunity to meet potential business associates and should be attended by all who are considering entering the Brazilian sporting goods market. In choosing a partner, it is crucial to bear in mind the ability of the party to perform after- sales service such as maintenance of equipment. Additionally, companies should take into consideration the partnerâ€™s capacity for geographic distribution, as well as its ability to offer financing options to potential clients. Other strategies to penetrate the market include identification of an agent. However, these are rarely going to be exclusive, which might pose a conflict of interest.</p>
