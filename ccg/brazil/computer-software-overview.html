        <p>The Brazilian IT industry is considered the seventh largest in the world, with an investment of US$61.6 billion, a 15.4% increase compared to 2012. According to a research done by IDC (International Data Corporation) in partnership with Brazilian Association of Software Companies (ABES), investments made in software and IT services reach US$25.1 billion, a 10.1% increase compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>Given the forecast for growth of the Brazilian economy over the next several years, Brazilian IT spending should increase at a healthy pace. The most significant trend in this sector is the increase of data communication in mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), which is expected to continue over the next few years. Infrastructure investments in preparation for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are expected to drive new spending on software. As a result, Brazilâ€™s software services market, which already has the fastest rate of growth in Latin America, is projected to exceed 10% per year until 2015.</p>

<p>According to ABES, Brazil's large and growing economy and technology adoption make it an outstanding market for technology and service providers seeking opportunities for global expansion.</p>

<p>The services and financial sectors represent almost 50% of the user market, followed by the telecom, industry, trade, government, oil and gas, and agricultural sectors. The software market consists of nearly 10,300 companies dedicated to the development, production and distribution of software and services. Of the segment in software development and production, 93% can be classified as small and medium sized enterprises.</p>
