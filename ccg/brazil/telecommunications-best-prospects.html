        <p><strong>Cellular Phone Services</strong>: 2013 represented a milestone year for the Brazilian mobile market, when it reached a density of more than 135 lines per 100 inhabitants. It was a year of transition, as well, with the voice market reaching maturity and operators increasing their focus on mobile broadband, which grew 48% in 2013. In the near future, mobile operators will not be able to count on the growth of their cellular base to leverage an increase in revenues. Voice revenues are likely to drop, pressured by decreases in the prices charged for on- net calls and by a drop in interconnection revenue determined by the Brazilian regulatory agency Anatel.</p>

<p>Considering this scenario, operators will continue to focus on data services to stimulate smartphone sales and expand their 3G and 4G networks. While GSM represents more than 55% of mobile lines, migration from GSM handsets to 3G will accelerate through 2014. Nevertheless, 3G handsets are not likely to overtake GSM devices until 2015. Competition may become stronger due to the introduction of Nextel’s 3G operations, whose biggest growth comes from the postpaid segment, which in 2013 increased at a faster rate than prepaid. Some new players like Virgin Mobile have just begun mobile virtual network operator services (MVNO) in Brazil, which could then entice other companies to enter the market and help to establish the MVNO market. However, the current market share ranking of the cellular operators is expected to remain the same with Vivo likely to keep its leadership, followed by TIM, Claro and Oi.</p>

<p><strong>Wireline Market</strong>: For the fixed services market, which includes fixed telephony, broadband and Pay-TV services, the focus will be on increasing investments in Fiber-to-the- Home (FTTX)-based fixed broadband networks. Fixed broadband grew 12% in 2013 and is expected to continue growing at an annual rate of 10%. Pay-TV, which increased 16.8% in 2013 due to Direct-to-Home TV, is likely to keep this growth rate in 2014, together with large growth expected for cable TV and Internet Protocol TV services.</p>

<p><strong>Broadband/Satellite</strong>: With a promising economic outlook and rising prosperity, demand for broadband in Brazil continues to soar. Broadband operators have been struggling to meet the growing demand, which has led to system overload problems. The Government of Brazil (GOB) has been drafting plans to spread broadband across the country in one of the world's largest infrastructure projects. Two major factors have inhibited the growth of broadband in Brazil: shortage of fixed-line infrastructure and broadband prices, which are too high for the Brazilian socio-economic environment. On the other hand, the growth of mobile broadband in Brazil is increasing at a rate of 12% this year. The largest wireless telecom carriers (with parent companies in parentheses) and respective market share are shown below:</p>

<p>Vivo (Telefônica) 28.6%</p>

<p>Tim (Telecom Itália) 27.0%</p>

<p>Claro (América Movil) 25.1%</p>

<p>Oi (Private Brazilian Funds &amp; Portugal Telecom) 18.5%</p>

<p>In 2013, Brazil decided to form its own satellite company to provide a civil-military satellite communications system and to lay the groundwork for assuring Brazil’s future satellite autonomy. The GOB founded Visiona Tecnologia Espacial, a company jointly owned by Embraer (51%) and Telebras (49%). The initial objective is the integration of the government’s Defense and Strategic Communications Geostationary Satellite (SGDC) system, which addresses the satellite communications needs of the federal government. This includes the National Broadband Program (PNBL) and a broad spectrum of strategic and defense communications. The SGDC will also signal Brazil’s entry into the high-throughput satellite market, as it will carry 50 Ka-band transponders with an aggregate 80 gigabits per second of throughput capacity. Brazil’s Ministry of Communications will use this satellite to extend Internet access throughout the country.</p>

<p><strong>Media</strong>: Free-on-the-air broadcast (non-cable) television companies are subject to a regulation that requires 80% of their programming content to be of Brazilian origin. Foreign cable and satellite television programmers are subject to an 11% remittance tax; however, the tax can be avoided if the programmer invests 3% of its remittances in co-production of Brazilian audio-visual services. President Rousseff signed a new law in September 2011 encompassing the subscription television market, including satellite and cable TV. Under the new law, telecom companies will now be allowed to offer television packages with their service. The law also removed the previous 49% limit on foreign ownership of cable TV companies.</p>
