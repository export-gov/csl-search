<p>Brazil is a large, dynamic, and rapidly growing market for agricultural equipment. This growth is driven by an extensive commercial farming sector that itself is a major global exporter of agricultural commodities, such as soybeans, coffee, sugar, corn, meat and orange juice.</p>

<p>These estimated value statistics are based on official data on agricultural machinery production units per year, published by the Brazilian Automotive Vehicles Manufacturers Association (ANFAVEA). Figures include only tillers, wheel tractors, crawler tractors, combines, loaders and backhoes. The domestic industry will likely supply most of the growing demand for agricultural machinery. In 2013, according to ANFAVEA, Brazil produced 100,451 agricultural machines, 20% more than in 2012. This is mainly due to a price increase on agricultural commodities, as well as the growth of Brazil’s large and prosperous domestic market for food and other agricultural products. Imports decreased 21% in 2013, reaching 1,716 units. In 2014, it is estimated that imports will decrease by 50% and local machinery production by 13%.</p>

<p>The 2014 estimate for purchases in Brazil’s agricultural machinery market is around US$11 billion. Of that amount, nearly US$214 million will likely be imported, with approximately US$100 million being imported from the United States. Although Brazil’s market for machinery sales have increased considerably in recent years, rising benchmark interest rates and a reduction in interest rate subsidies for farmers mean that machinery sales growth has slowed down in recent months and has been negative since the end of 2013.</p>

<p>Brazil has 16 industrial production units owned by seven large agricultural equipment manufacturers, including AGCO (Massey Ferguson/Valtra), Agrale, Caterpillar, John Deere, Komatsu, Valtra and CNH New Holland Fiat Allis.</p>
