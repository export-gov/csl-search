        <p>While Brazil is a major agricultural country with a modern food processing sector, there are export opportunities for U.S. companies. In 2012, Brazil imported consumer-oriented food products valued at US$4.2 billion, up 4 percent from the previous year. Mercosul* countries and the European Union captured the lionâ€™s share of this market, registering 44 percent and 24 percent market share, respectively. U.S. exports reached US$273 million, a seven percent market share. Although up a full point from 2011, the United States must establish a more aggressive approach toward the Brazilian market if U.S. companies are to significantly increase exports of food and agricultural product.</p>

<p><em>(*) MERCOSUL is the Southern Common Market, comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela, which promotes free trade of goods, services, and production inputs.</em></p>
