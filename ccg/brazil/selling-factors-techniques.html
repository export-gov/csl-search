        <p>Price and payment terms are extremely important sales factors. Generally, U.S. goods are perceived as high quality; however, depending on quality as the primary competitive advantage may be risky. To be competitive, U.S. companies should adapt their products to local technical requirements and culture. In some sectors, competing with an ever increasing amount of Chinese imports can be difficult because of their low prices. Therefore, emphasizing product quality, customer service, after-sale service, financing arrangements, and warranty terms are key competitive advantages for U.S. companies. As Brazilian companies become more concerned with environmental stewardship, it is also advisable to demonstrate commitment to sustainable development practices when introducing new products into this market.</p>
