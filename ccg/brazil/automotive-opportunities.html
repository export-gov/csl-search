        <p>Increased taxes on imported vehicles and Inovar Auto Program incentives are attracting substantial automotive investments. Industry experts reported that eight OEMs (Audi, BMW, Chery, Foton, JAC, Land Rover, MB and Sinotruck) will build their first automobile plants in Brazil from 2014 to 2016, which corresponds to investments of R$5 Billion (US$2.12 billion), whereas the already established Fiat, Honda and Nissan will build new plants.</p>

<p>There are currently approximately 40 automobile manufacturing plants in Brazil, as follows:</p>

<p>Automobile Plants: (Toyota, Ford, GM, VW, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Peugeot, Citroen, Mercedes Benz, Renault, Nissan, Honda);</p>

<p>Truck Plants: (Mercedes Benz, Agrale, Iveco, Ford, International, MAN, Scania, Volvo);</p>

<p>Bus Plants: (Agrale, Iveco, MAN, Mercedes Benz, Scania, Volvo and the newly established DAF Trucks).</p>

<p>Nearly all Brazil-made cars are flex fuel, and run on ethanol, gasoline or any combination of the two fuels. Brazil’s automotive parts industry consists of Brazilian owned (27% of the sales value) and internationally owned (73% of the sales value) companies. There is a significant presence of U.S. automotive parts suppliers, including Delphi, Visteon, TRW, Dana, Arvin-Meritor, Cummins Engines, MWM-Diesel, and Eaton.</p>

<p>Inovar Auto requires that several production processes be performed in Brazil and also establishes local content requirement for automotive parts. There are currently discussions about the implementation of an Inovar Autoparts program, which will, among other items, consist of financial support to local automotive parts manufacturers and include measures to attract direct investments to the sector. According to the National Automobile Industry Association (ANFAVEA), the process of tracking the origin of imported automotive parts is expected to start in the next few months. This should help Brazil’s auto parts industry identify the OEMs needs and allow them to substitute imported parts with local production.</p>
