        <p>Yellow fever vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization if the traveler’s destination in Brazil includes any of the following states: Acre, Amazonas, Amapá, Federal District (Brasília), Goiás, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins. Beyond yellow fever, insect-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue are also present in Brazil. There is a low risk for malaria outside of the Amazonian region and it can be prevented through medication. There is currently no vaccination for dengue.</p>

<p>A polio vaccination certificate is mandatory at the port of entry in Brazil for children between the ages of three months and six years.</p>
