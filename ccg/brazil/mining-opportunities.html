        <p>The Brazilian market for mining equipment is very competitive. Most large multinational manufacturers have factories in Brazil, where they manufacture for the domestic market and frequently also export from Brazil to many other countries. Typically, these companies use 50% to 90% Brazilian-made components to build their equipment in Brazil, in terms of value of the final product. For example, Caterpillar has a huge factory in Brazil, with total sales of more than US$2 billion/year, and it exports more than 50% of its Brazilian- made machines all over the world. In 2012, Caterpillar, which has produced a traditional line of earthmoving machinery in Brazil for over 50 years, has added a locomotive factory.</p>

<p>Additional U.S. and other international firms with factories in Brazil include:</p>

<p>Australia   Orica</p>

<p>Finland     Metso, Outokumpu</p>

<p>France      Michelin Tires, Saint Gobain</p>

<p>Germany     Koch, Kuttner, Liebherr, MAN, Mercedes Benz, Schaeffler, Schenk Process, Siemens, Thyssen Krupp, Voith, WehrAlstom</p>

<p>Italy       Case New Holland, FIAT, Iveco</p>

<p>Japan       Komatsu, NSK, Toshiba</p>

<p>Sweden      Asea BB, Atlas Copco, Sandvik, Scania, SKF, Tamrock, Volvo</p>

<p>UK          JCB</p>

<p>USA         3M, Cummins, Eaton, GE, Goodyear, Ingersoll Rand, ITT, P&amp;H MinePro, Terex, Timken</p>

<p>There are many Brazilian manufacturers competing with similar technologies, or which have technology transfer agreements with foreign companies and dominate big shares of the domestic market. The largest ones include Bardella, Dedini, Isomonte, Jaraguá, Randon, and Villares. There are also hundreds of medium-sized Brazilian companies that specialize in manufacturing all types of parts and components for the suppliers of turn-key equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Prospective Buyers:</strong></p>

<p><strong>VALE S.A. (Formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce)</strong> is Brazil’s largest, and the world’s second largest mining company. Privatized in 1997, VALE is responsible for nearly 50% of Brazil’s mineral output in terms of value, and represents an excellent opportunity for U.S. equipment suppliers. VALE produces nearly 80% of all Brazil’s iron ore output, 100% of potash, 85% of manganese, 43% of kaolin, 80% of bauxite, and is also the top player in aluminum, copper, and nickel production. The output of its main minerals in 2013 was 299.8 million metric tons (Mt) of iron ore, plus 39.0 Mt of iron ore pellets, 2.378 Mt of manganese ore, 260,000 tons of nickel (metal content in ore), 15 Mt of bauxite, 370,000 tons of copper (contents in ore), 492,000 tons of potassium chloride, 8.8 Mt of coal and 8.3 Mt of phosphate rock. VALE is also the top logistics player in Brazil, especially for ports and railroads, not only for its own use, but also as a supplier of logistics services to other companies. It is the largest Brazilian consumer of electricity. Over the last decade, VALE has diversified further, buying the Canadian company INCO (the world’s largest nickel producer), and increasing coal projects in Australia and Mozambique.</p>

<p><strong>Anglo American</strong> has a large iron ore project located in Minas Gerais, which will start producing in 2014 with an output of 26 million metric tons. Since 2010, Anglo also has a big nickel project named “Barro Alto,” with an output of 36,000 t/year in Ferro-nickel alloys.</p>

<p><strong>AngloGold Ashanti</strong> is the second largest gold producer in Brazil, with an output of nearly 500,000 troy ounces/year, and projects to increase its output in Brazil to 670,000 troy ounces in the next three years.</p>

<p><strong>MMX</strong> started three large iron ore projects in Brazil in 2007, but most part of these projects have been either sold or postponed. Its output in 2012 was 9 million t/y of iron ore.</p>

<p><strong>Usiminas</strong>, Brazil’s largest steel manufacturer has an output of currently 13 Mt of iron ore, and projects to expand to 29 Mt by 2017, in a joint-venture with Japanese-owned Sumitomo.</p>

<p><strong>CSN</strong> operations yielded 30 Mt/y of iron ore in 2013, with a project to expand its output to 40 Mt/y. It is also the second largest Brazilian steel producer.</p>

<p><strong>ArcelorMittal</strong> had an output of 4 Mt of iron ore in 2012, and projects expansion to 10 Mt by 2015. This company is Brazil’s third largest steel producer.</p>

<p><strong>Samarco</strong> yielded 24 Mt of iron ore and 17 Mt/y of iron ore pellets in 2012. The company is a consortium between Vale and BHP Billiton. It started a new pelletizing mill in April 2014, increasing its capacity to 30 Mt of pellets.</p>

<p><strong>Kinross</strong> Group of Canada became Brazil’s largest gold producer in 2008, when it started up a new project of US$ 550 million and increased its output of gold metal from 5.4 to 17.2 metric tons /year.</p>

<p><strong>Votorantim</strong> is the only local producer of zinc, and has a share of approximately 40% of the local production of cement. This Brazilian group is a big producer of bauxite and aluminum.</p>

<p><strong>MRN</strong> is the largest producer of bauxite in the world, with 18 Mt/y. The company is a consortium that includes Vale (40%), BHP Billiton Metals (14.8%), Alcan (12%), CBA (10%), Alcoa (13.58%), Norsk Hydro (5%), and Abalco (4.62%).</p>

<p><strong>Market Entry:</strong></p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary for foreign manufacturers of equipment to have some degree of local presence in Brazil. Most multinational manufacturers of mining equipment already have factories in Brazil. Smaller companies that cannot afford to establish a local subsidiary must at least have a good Brazilian representative that can supply or subcontract technical maintenance and some degree of local assembling.</p>

<p>Brazil’s mining companies, even the very large ones, prefer to contact a Brazil-based representative and do all the import procedures through them, instead of contacting the foreign suppliers directly.</p>

<p>Price and just-in-time delivery for components are key factors for most importers. Some large mining companies have their own bonded warehouses where they store imported products in Brazil, locked under customs’ agreement. These products will go through customs and be paid only when they really need to be used. Unskilled labor is relatively cheap in Brazil compared to the U.S., so equipment that eliminates large numbers of employees is not necessarily financially attractive to Brazilian companies. Highly qualified labors, especially engineers, earn wages that are competitive with those in the U.S.</p>

<p>Import taxes in Brazil are very high. Import duty on mining equipment is normally between 5 to 12%, calculated based on the CIF (cost, insurance and freight) price. These import duties are adopted as a single tariff structure for the Mercosul free trade area which also includes Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. There are also three local taxes.</p>

<p>The following taxes apply to both local and foreign products:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IPI Industrialized Products Tax, federal tax calculated on top of the CIF price plus Import Tax, is 5% to 8% for most products</p></li>
<li><p>ICMS Merchandise and Services Circulation Tax, a state government value-added tax, is 18% of the final price in most Brazilian states and products</p></li>
<li><p>PIS/COFINS, Social Integration and Social Security Financing Contributions: 9.25% but can represent up to 12.63% of the CIF price due to complex calculation formula</p></li>
<li><p>Additional Miscellaneous Taxes and Fees: Warehousing, handling charges at port, transportation, etc.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Exposibram, the Brazilian mining show, is held every year in September, alternating between the cities of Belo Horizonte and Belem. It is sponsored and organized by IBRAM, with support from most local mining companies and manufacturers of mining equipment. This show is recommended for U.S. companies looking to understand or partner with Brazilian mining companies, and to make personal contact with related government entities that travel to the show from around the country. Kallman Worldwide is the representative of this show in the USA. Website: <a href="http://www.exposibram.org.br">http://www.exposibram.org.br</a>.</p>
