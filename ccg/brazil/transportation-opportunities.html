        <p>Brazil has historically invested in other sectors, to the detriment of infrastructure; resulting in an infrastructure deficit. Recent growth and new opportunities arising in Brazil are shifting the focus to infrastructure. The hosting of international events such as this year’s World Cup and the Summer Olympic Games in 2016 is compelling Brazil to develop a modern transportation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Despite the complexities of doing business in Brazil, the outlook is good for business development in the region; there is much room for growth between U.S. companies and Brazil in particular. The United States is Brazil’s third largest trading partner (after the EU and China).</p>

<p>Market analysts agree with the GOB’s approach of working with the private sector in order to improve the nation's roads, railways and ports. This approach could help Brazil focus on shorter-term goals, such as the Olympic Games, with long-term benefits. Today, only 14% of Brazil's roads are paved; traffic congestion in the large cities is a serious problem. Long queues of trucks outside of ports cause delays for imports and exports. In a recent study by the World Economic Forum, Brazil ranked 119th out of 142 countries in terms of road quality and 130th in terms of quality of its ports.</p>

<p>Although there are major export opportunities in Brazil, there are also substantial challenges, including relatively high tariffs with a heavy and complex customs system, tax structure, and regulatory framework. Additionally, U.S. exporters face expanding GOB involvement in the marketplace to promote the development or preservation of those Brazilian industries which the government deems to be strategic. This includes increased use of local content and technology transfer requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Sales to the Government</strong>: GOB procurement rules apply to purchases by government entities and state-owned companies. Brazil has an open competition process for major government procurements. The Brazilian government may not make a distinction between domestic and foreign-owned companies during the tendering process; however, when two equally qualified vendors are considered, the law’s implementing regulations provide for a preference for Brazilian goods and services. Price is to be the overriding factor in selecting suppliers. However, the law's implementing regulations also allow for the consideration of non-price factors, giving preferences to certain goods produced in Brazil and stipulating local content requirements to be eligible for fiscal benefits. Additionally, nearly all bids require the establishment of a local representative for any foreign company bidding.</p>
