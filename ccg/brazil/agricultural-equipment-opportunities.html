        <p>Agribusiness is one of Brazil’s largest economic sectors. It is well diversified and the country is largely self-sufficient in food. In 2013, agribusiness was responsible for 23% of Brazil’s GDP (US$516 billion). It represented 42% of Brazilian exports (US$101 billion), and the sector employs nearly 40% of Brazil’s workforce.</p>

<p>Brazil’s rise as a leading market for agricultural equipment is the result of the country’s position as one of the world’s largest exporters of agricultural commodities. Soybeans and related products, sugar, coffee, corn, orange juice and meat are Brazil’s leading export commodities. Brazil’s grain production for the harvest period 2012/2013 was 189 M/t, and it is estimated that it will increase to 191 M/t for the 2013/2014 harvest period, up 1%. Soybean and corn account for the majority of grain production. Thus, reflecting a slower but still tremendous demand for agricultural machinery in the last months.</p>

<p>Brazil is also one of the few countries still capable of increasing its planted area. Large portions of Brazil’s <em>cerrado</em> (savannah or prairie region) are still available for cultivation, leaving considerable room for growth of the country’s commercial agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Brazilian farmers enjoy a comparative advantage in many segments, especially in the grain, fruit, fiber, and animal protein sectors. This advantage is due to a temperate climate with plenty of light and the world’s largest surface and ground fresh water reserves, in addition to an excellent quality and diversity of soils and agro-ecological systems.</p>
