        <p>In recent years, China liberalized its distribution system to provide full trading and distribution rights for foreign firms in most industry sectors, yet exceptions remain in place for the distribution of books, film and audio recordings. New laws removed earlier restrictions on size requirements for trading and distribution firms, thus paving the way for competition from small businesses.</p>

<p>While the outright prohibition of foreign invested firms to import, export and distribute goods in China has improved, the licensing and approval process remains difficult, time consuming and highly opaque. A standard business license is typically issued by municipal commercial agencies, in China referred to as the Administration of Industry and Commerce. Distribution rights for such industries are often approved by a higher-level authority, a municipal or provincial Commission of Commerce. This effectively adds another layer of bureaucratic hurdles a foreign investor will need to navigate.</p>

<p>There are different sales channels available to foreign companies selling in China, including trading companies, distributors, and local agents. Trading companies with import/export rights take care of customs formalities; distributors build sales channels and handle stock and inventory; and local agents retail products to consumers.</p>
