        <p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR), or what is more commonly known as sustainability, is a new concept for domestic companies in China and is less widely accepted than in the United States. Investors looking to partner with Chinese companies or expand operations with Chinese suppliers face challenges ensuring domestic firms meet international standards in such areas as labor, the environment and good manufacturing practices. China's 12th Five-Year Plan highlights sustainability issues as a means to draw attention to the subject. Foreign-invested enterprises tend to follow generally accepted CSR principles, and most report annually on their CSR policies and achievements.</p>
