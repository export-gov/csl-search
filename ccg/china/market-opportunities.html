<li>The growth of imports from the United States in many key sectors, such as energy, chemicals, transportation, medical equipment, construction, machinery and a range of services, suggests that China will remain an important and viable market for a wide range of products and services. With growing numbers of Chinese traveling abroad for education and leisure purposes, China's contribution to U.S. educational institutions and the tourism industry is increasingly important as well.</li>
<li>China is a challenging market and requires a strong understanding of a firm's capabilities and in-depth knowledge of the market. Before making a decision to enter the Chinese market, potential exporters should first consider their own resources, past exporting experience, and have a willingness to commit a significant amount of time exploring opportunities for their products and services in China. CS has continued to emphasize that long-term relationships are key to finding a good partner in China. To maximize their contacts, companies should aim at forming a network of relationships with people at various levels across a broad range of organizations.</li>
