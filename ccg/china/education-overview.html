        <p>U.S. colleges and universities remain the preferred overseas destination for students from China, which remains the leading source of foreign students in the United States. Short-term training programs, technical schools and workshops in specialized fields as well as business education are particularly sought after. In December 2011, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) along with the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) jointly released a revised edition of the Guiding Catalogue on Foreign Investment in Industry, replacing the 2007 edition. The 2011 revised Catalogue adds "training and vocational education" to the so-called "encouraged" list of industries for foreign direct investment. (The Catalogue includes four categories: "encouraged," "restricted," "prohibited" and "permitted".) U.S. educational organizations can also sell teaching materials and equipment, convey the latest methodologies and case studies, exchange faculty, and provide educational consulting services.</p>
