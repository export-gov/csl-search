        <p>The demand for modern environmental monitoring instruments in China remains high, with urgent need for advanced NOx emission reduction equipment, automatic monitoring systems and online continuous monitoring systems.</p>

<p>Types of NOx emission reduction equipment technology:<br/>
* Combustion Modification<br/>
* SNCR (Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction)<br/>
* SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction)<br/>
* Combination Methods</p>

<p>Rising concerns about China's environment have led to a surge in demand for the following environmental monitoring instruments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Automatic air monitoring systems on the ground: high value-added equipment which is automatic, multi-functional, instant, systematic, and intelligent is considered the most promising in China. Typical products:</li>
<li>On-line and/or automatic continuous emission monitoring systems for key pollution sources

<pre><code>- Carbon Monoxide (CO)  
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)  
- Nitrogen Oxides (NO-NO2-NOX)  
- Ozone (O3)  
- Particulate Matter (PM10/2.5)  
</code></pre></li>
<li>Automatic and continuous monitoring systems for organic pollutants

<pre><code>- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  
</code></pre></li>
<li>On-line dust monitors</li>
<li>On-site portable emergency gas monitoring equipment</li>
<li><p>Portable and personal particulate monitors</p></li>
<li><p>Remote monitoring systems: Investments will also increase for satellite ground systems and satellite image analysis systems to analyze the quality of the environment and changing long-term trends. China's emphasis on the protection of the ecological environment has created an enormous demand for remote sensing satellites and monitoring equipment. The industry is gradually transferring from solely ground monitoring stations to both ground and remote monitoring. Potential segments include:</p></li>
<li>Vehicle-borne equipment, such as mobile monitoring vans</li>
<li>Ship-borne equipment</li>
<li>Satellite-borne equipment and instruments, such as lesser radar monitors for pollution</li>
<li><p>GSM/GPRS modem technology (allowing remote control and data retrieval from air quality monitoring stations located almost anywhere)</p></li>
<li><p>Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) laboratory equipment, which is needed in all monitoring stations and laboratories. Instruments include:</p></li>
<li>PM2.5 samplers</li>
<li>SO2 analyzers</li>
<li>NOx analyzers</li>
<li>PM10 samplers</li>
<li>Dynamic gas dilution/mixing/calibration systems</li>
<li>High precision flow meters</li>
</ol>


<p>Below is a list of major prospective buyers in China:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP)</li>
<li>China National Environmental Monitoring Center</li>
<li>Local environment protection bureaus and environmental monitoring centers:</li>
</ul>


<p>National key pollution sources â€“ Major industries below:<br/>
* Power plants<br/>
* Petrochemicals<br/>
* Refineries<br/>
* Building materials (especially cement)<br/>
* Metallurgy</p>

<p>Other prospective buyers<br/>
* Heavily polluting enterprises engaged in the above industries<br/>
* Laboratories, research institutes (environment academies), and universities<br/>
* Enterprises/Organizations that need high-level industry hygiene and health standards:<br/>
  * Center for Disease Control (CDC)<br/>
  * Hazardous gas leakage monitoring in industries like petrochemical and chemicals</p>
