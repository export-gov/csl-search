        <p>The system for regulation of foreign commercial activity in China is difficult to navigate and is not fully transparent. Companies new to the market are strongly encouraged to retain professional services to structure commercial transactions. Establishing a wholly foreign owned subsidiary, joint venture, or representative office requires compliance with complex contract approval requirements, business registration requirements, taxation regulations and statutes, and labor regulations. Many U.S. banks, accountants, attorneys, and consultants have established offices in China and are familiar with Chinese requirements. Some Chinese professional service providers also have substantial experience serving foreign clients.</p>

<p><strong>Accountants</strong></p>

<p>Chinese law requires representative offices and foreign-invested enterprises to engage the services of accountants registered in China to prepare official submission of annual financial statements and other specified financial documents. Therefore, only Chinese accountants and joint venture accounting firms may provide these services. All of the major U.S. accounting firms have established offices in China and provide services including audit, tax and advisory services, the preparation of investment feasibility studies, and setting up accounting systems that are in compliance with Chinese law.</p>

<p><strong>Attorneys</strong></p>

<p>Over one hundred U.S. and international law firms have received approval to register in China as foreign law firms, and currently operate in China. Foreign law firms registered in China are restricted to advising clients on legal matters pertaining to the jurisdiction where they are licensed and general international business practices. Although a foreign lawyer may not offer a legal opinion, clients can obtain assistance with structuring transactions, drafting contracts and resolving disputes. Only attorneys licensed in China may appear in court and provide legal advice on Chinese legal matters. Chinese lawyers are allowed to work at foreign law firms, but they may not practice law as licensed Chinese attorneys. Foreign lawyers are not permitted to qualify to practice law in China and are not allowed to form joint ventures with Chinese lawyers.</p>

<p>The legal services that a foreign law office can provide are limited to: 1) providing consulting services to its clients with regard to the home legal affairs for which it is licensed and international conventions and practices; 2) providing legal services to its clients or Chinese law firms with regard to legal affairs in the country/region for which it is licensed; 3) entrusting Chinese law firms with regard to China legal affairs on behalf of its foreign clients; 4) establishing long-term contractual relationships with Chinese law firms with regard to legal clientele; and 5) providing information with regard to the impact of Chinese legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Management Consultants</strong></p>

<p>Foreign companies new to the Chinese market often engage the services of local consultants to develop market entry strategies, conduct due diligence investigations, and identify potential investment partners, sales agents and customers. Most of the major foreign consulting firms are active in the Chinese market, along with a number of small niche players, as well as many local companies.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>

<p>Almost 100,000 advertising firms exist in China, of which perhaps 400 are foreign invested enterprises. Many major international advertising firms have established a presence in China. Companies new to the market can gain valuable advice from top-notch advertising firms on how to craft an effective advertising strategy that is responsive to Chinese consumer preferences and cultural differences. Advertising is strictly regulated in China, and penalties for violation of the law through misleading advertisements, unauthorized use of national symbols, or other prohibited forms of advertising are subject to fines.</p>

<p>The U.S. Commercial Service maintains lists of U.S. law, accounting and consulting firms with offices in China, as well as lists of Chinese firms with whom the Commercial Office or its customers have had favorable dealings.
