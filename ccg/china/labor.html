        <p>Human resource issues remain a major concern for American companies operating in China. Difficulties in hiring appropriately skilled labor, navigating many new and often ill-defined labor and social safety net laws, restrictions on the mobility of workers, and the lack of independent trade unions combine to create a challenging environment for foreign-invested enterprises.</p>

<p>Independent trade unions are illegal in China. Officially sanctioned trade unions must affiliate with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), which is an arm of the Communist Party. It is illegal for employers to oppose efforts to establish ACFTU unions. While worker protests and work stoppages occur regularly, the right to strike is not protected by law.</p>

<p>China has not ratified core International Labor Organization conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining, but has ratified conventions prohibiting child labor and employment discrimination. Apart from a lack of freedom of association and the right to strike, Chinese labor laws generally meet international labor standards. However, enforcement of existing labor regulations is poor.</p>
