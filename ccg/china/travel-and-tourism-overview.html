<p>American tour operators, district marketing offices, hotels and airlines will need to cooperate with each other, as well as with government entities, in order to capture more of this highly profitable market. To foster cooperation, industry players and the Commercial Service are in the process of revitalizing a VisitUSA Committee.</p>
