        <p>The Chinese franchising market is dominated by traditional franchise operations like food and beverage (F&amp;B) and retail outlets. According to CCFA, nearly 40 percent of all franchisers in China are engaged in such industries. U.S. franchisers established a particularly strong foothold in the F&amp;B market.</p>

<p>Franchising opportunities abound in non-F&amp;B industries. The best prospects in this form of franchising include sectors such as car rental and services, budget hotel chains, general business services and fitness.</p>
