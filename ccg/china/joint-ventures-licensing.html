        <p>Joint ventures, although a useful way to limit investment and quickly access the market, entail some degree of risk (loss of control of investment, theft of intellectual property, conflicts of interest, etc.). Most U.S. investment in China is now in the form of 100 percent U.S.-owned companies, rather than joint ventures. As China has opened its market, the number of wholly owned foreign entities (WOFE's) has increased. To date nearly 75 percent of new investments are WOFE's. A U.S. company contemplating a JV should clearly understand what their partner brings to the table and what benefits there might be to establishing a JV rather than a WOFE.</p>

<p>Technology transfer is another initial market entry approach used by many companies. It offers short-term profits but runs the risk of creating long-term competitors. Due to this concern, as well as intellectual property considerations and the lower technical level prevailing in the Chinese market, some firms attempt to license older technology, promising higher-level access at some future date or in the context of a future joint venture arrangement.</p>

<p>Licensing contracts must be approved by and registered with the Ministry of Commerce. A tax of 10 percent to 20 percent (depending on the technology involved and the existing applicable bilateral tax treaty) is withheld on royalty payments.</p>
