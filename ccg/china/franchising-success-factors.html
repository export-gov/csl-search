        <p>Major international franchise firms have established the following best practices for doing business in China:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register the brand in China before entering the China market.</li>
<li>Find local partners who can help navigate the local business environment.</li>
<li>Understand the cultural differences and adjust market access strategies accordingly.</li>
<li>Have an ability and willingness to localize your product if necessary, without changing the core product.</li>
<li>Minimize the price of the final product and the franchising fee to achieve rapid expansion and mass acceptance.</li>
<li>Manage government relations by establishing and maintaining solid working relationships with relevant Chinese Government agencies.</li>
</ul>


<p>Foreign franchise brands are receiving greater interest from second and third-tier market developers. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in F&amp;B companies entering the market as wholly owned enterprises to manage the brand, demonstrate proof-of-concept and create a strong foothold prior to expanding into the franchise model.</p>
