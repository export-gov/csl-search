The oilseed meal supply in Colombia is composed mainly of soybean meal, cottonseed meal, palm kernel meal, and sesame seed meal. All fishmeal used in the country is imported from PeruÃÅ, Chile, and Ecuador. The FTA eliminated duties on all imports of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal. Primary competitors are MERCOSUR countries.
