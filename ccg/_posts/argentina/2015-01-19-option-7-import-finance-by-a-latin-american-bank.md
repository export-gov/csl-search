**Description:**

A Latin American bank pays a US exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a Latin American buyer. The Latin American bank is essentially providing the Latin American buyer a loan and the Latin American buyer will have to repay the bank as contractually agreed in the financing agreement between the bank and the buyer. In Latin America, these financings generally have a 6-month grace period after which the buyer must begin repaying the Bank.

**Comments:**

â€¢ Although this option is extremely expensive for Latin American buyers it is frequently the only alternative available to them, particularly when they are purchasing larger ticket capital equipment items.
