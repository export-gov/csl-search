Biofuels, biomass, wind and solar energy hold huge potential in Argentina. However, the market for wind and solar generation seems to be more promising given its stage of development. Direct sales to municipal governments, electric cooperatives, and private companies are common. Support by a local reputable partner is important, as local financing is scarce.

Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
