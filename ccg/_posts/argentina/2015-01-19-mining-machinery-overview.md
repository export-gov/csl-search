The mining industry in Argentina continues to expand following a sustained upward trend. Nevertheless, a significant number of mining projects throughout Argentina have not reached full development. Regulatory changes in general investment legislation and in specific mining-sector legislation in the early 1990s favored a significant increase in foreign investment in the industry. The sectorâ€™s growth propelled local demand for mining machinery and equipment. Most of the 250+ companies with operations in Argentina reduced their activity level significantly during the economic crisis in order to preserve their assets. Most of the market players are junior companies; however, sector dynamics and industry experts coincide that investments will continue to increase.

Several new mines are expected to be built in this decade, which represent future business opportunities for U.S. suppliers of mining equipment and machinery. Nevertheless, existing mines currently in operation also represent significant potential for the provision of machinery, equipment and parts.
