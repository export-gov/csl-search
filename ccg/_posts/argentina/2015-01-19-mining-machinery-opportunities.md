Demand for imported goods is evenly distributed between large digging, leveling, scraping, excavating, quarrying, and earth moving equipment (HS 8430), and equipment for sorting, screening, separating, washing, crushing, and grinding (HS 8474), including healthy volumes of parts and tools (HS 8431 and 8207). Further, high tech equipment, such as GPS, radars, and Wi-Fi data transmission systems are also in demand. U.S. suppliers continue to dominate the market; however, Brazilian, Asian, and Canadian competitors are expanding steadily.

Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits. (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
