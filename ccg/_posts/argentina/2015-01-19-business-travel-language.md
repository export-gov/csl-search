Spanish is the national language of Argentina, although many businesspeople speak English as well as other European languages. Do not assume, however, that your contacts will speak English. For U.S. businesspeople who already speak Spanish, note that Argentina has distinct differences in pronunciation, cadence, and vocabulary.

Almost all business in Argentina is conducted in Spanish, and all documents and records must be in that language to constitute valid evidence. Business documents in a foreign language should be translated by a certified public translator to be presented for legal purposes to Argentine authorities. A list of certified public translators is available upon request from the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina ([Office.BuenosAires@trade.gov](Office.BuenosAires@trade.gov)).
