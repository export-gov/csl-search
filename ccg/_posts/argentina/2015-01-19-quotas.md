There is a quota system and special regime for auto parts. The bilateral auto agreement between Argentina and Brazil establishes preferential market access treatment for both countries to protect the MERCOSUR automobile industry. A complicated system of reciprocal obligations exists between Argentina and Brazil. Currently, there is a trade-balancing scheme that determines import levels for auto assemblers. The Argentine government separately sets annual quotas for official distributors of foreign cars and auto dealers, as well as for other firms and individuals. Foreign auto manufacturers (including U.S. firms) in MERCOSUR countries receive national treatment.

In addition, temporary quotas exist on organic chemicals (HS code 2915.90), fluoride of aluminum (2826.12), and petroleum resins (3911.10) affecting U.S. exports.
