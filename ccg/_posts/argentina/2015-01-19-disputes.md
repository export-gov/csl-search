When the selection of imported/foreign goods is challenged, the Secretariat of Industry will determine if the domestic goods offered meet all the requirements set forth in the contracting documents and can fulfill the expected functions (_idénticas o similares prestaciones_) in the same manner as the imported/foreign goods selected. The Secretariat may request the advice of the National Institute of Industrial Technology (_Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial-INTI_) or any other body accredited by the Argentine Accreditation Organization (_Organismo Argentino de Acreditación -OAA_). If the challenge fails, the challenging party pays the costs of the Secretariat's intervention; if the challenge succeeds, the bidder offering the imported/foreign goods pays the costs.

Argentina is not a signatory of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, but it is an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement.
