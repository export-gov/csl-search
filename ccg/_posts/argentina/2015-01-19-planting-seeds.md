#####Overview

The Argentine seed industry offers numerous growth prospects and opportunities in terms of
an increase in the demand for genetically modified seeds, higher commodity prices, and the
expansion of agricultural land area. Planting seeds are one of the most important agricultural
products imported into Argentina from the United States, totaling $23 million in 2012.

corn, clover, rye grass, and fescue. Likewise, seeds from vegetable crops and lawn grass seed
have been in demand.

#####Opportunities

Off-season production of corn and soybean seed has generated positive returns in the last few
years. Total exports of planting seeds for 2013 are estimated at $190 million. Total exports
of planting seeds for 2012 were $163 million. 

The new development of marginal areas for beef and dairy industries will mean that demand
for quality forage seeds will remain high. There is a strong demand for grasses suitable for
sub-tropical regions in the northern part of the country.
