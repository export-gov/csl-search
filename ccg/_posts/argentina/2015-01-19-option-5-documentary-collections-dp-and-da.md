**Overview:**

**Description:**

1.	US exporter delivers shipping documents and a trade draft to a bank in the US. This bank is known as the **remitting bank** and issues the collection order normally according to the ICC Uniform Rules for Collections. As a matter of additional risk protection, the US exporter will normally make any title documents consigned to the order of the Buyer’s bank.
2.	The bank in the US then forwards the shipping documents and the trade draft to its correspondent bank in Latin America. This bank is known as the **collecting bank**.
3.	The correspondent (collecting) bank then notifies the Latin American buyer that the collection order has arrived with the terms and documents are available upon their acceptance of the terms.
4.	Normally, foreign buyers will wait for confirmation that the goods have arrived at customs in their country.
5.	Then one of two things happens, depending on the trade draft payment mechanism selected by the US exporter
– either

	a.	_For Documents Against Payment (D/P)_, also referred to as _Cash Against Documents_ or _Sight Collection_, buyers will then pay the collecting bank against presentation of the seller’s “Sight” trade draft in order to receive the shipping documents so that they may then present the documents to their country’s customs agency for clearance of the goods. 

	**or**

	b.	_For Documents Against Acceptance (D/A)_, also referred to as _Term or Time Collections_, buyers will then accept, by signature, the Seller’s “Time trade draft in order to receive the shipping documents so that they may then obtain and subsequently present the documents to their country’s customs agency for clearance of the goods. After the term, normally 30, 60 or 90 days, buyers are obligated to pay the collecting bank that will in turn remit the funds to US exporters via their US remitting bank. Under this mechanism, the US exporter has extended payment terms to the buyer who must accept the terms of their trade draft which upon acceptance by the buyer becomes a legal and binding obligation between the parties and upon which the collecting bank can release the documents.

**Comments:**

•	Documents Against Payment (D/P) is considered to be a very secure payment mechanism for US exporters although they do face the risk that the foreign buyer will refuse to accept the goods. It is always wise for the US exporter to consult with their bank on how best to protect themselves, their collection order and their rights to, and transfer of, the title documents.

•	Documents Against Acceptance (D/A) is considered to be a risky payment mechanism and is not recommended for US exporters **unless** they have a great deal of experience with a foreign buyer or if the foreign buyer is large and considered extremely creditworthy. It is considered only slightly less risky than unsecured open account terms in that the buyer has signed a legally binding document pledging to pay.

Shipping documents forwarded to the correspondent bank normally include:

•	Bill of Lading OR Airway Bill.

•	Invoice.

•	Certificate of Origin (Sometimes).

•	Proof of Insurance (Sometimes).
