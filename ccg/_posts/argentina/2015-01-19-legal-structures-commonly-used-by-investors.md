Regardless of whether they are associated with local investors, foreign investors may do business in Argentina as individuals or through corporations, branches of foreign corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships, general partnerships, and joint ventures. Foreign corporations often operate in Argentina through a separately incorporated subsidiary rather than through a branch, primarily to reduce their potential liability. If a branch is used, all of the foreign corporation's assets, not only its Argentine assets, may be subject to potential liability. In contrast, if an Argentine or foreign subsidiary is used, the foreign corporation's liability generally will be limited to the assets owned by that subsidiary.

Registration Procedures: a law effective throughout Argentina regulates corporations. Corporations are set up with the approval of at least two legal or natural persons, whether Argentine or foreign.

A corporation may not be a partner in a partnership. A corporation can usually be established in three to four weeks if capital is supplied only in cash. If supplied in kind, the corporation can be established in about two months. A minimum of two founders is required with no maximum limit. Company founders must report a domicile in Argentina.

A minimum of two shareholders is required. No maximum is prescribed. Should a foreign company wish to act as shareholder of a local company, the company must be “qualified.” The cost of qualification proceedings is similar to the incorporation cost.

U.S. firms considering establishing operations in Argentina should fully investigate the tax and legal aspects of establishing a business with legal counsel before making any final decisions. To obtain a list of law firms, please [contact us](http://export.gov/argentina/contactus/index.asp).
