The local franchising industry is a challenging and highly competitive environment for international franchisors seeking local partners. Current market size is approximately $5 billion, with an annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent. Franchising sales account for approximately 2 percent of Argentina’s GDP. Currently, 88 percent of local franchises are of Argentine origin and approximately 12 percent are of international ownership.

There are 612 franchise brands, encompassing 27,621 units that employ approximately 165,000 people. During 2013, it is projected that approximately 2,700 new units will be opened in the marketplace, mainly in the apparel and food sectors. Tourism and health are two new segments in which franchising are growing.

The most popular areas for international franchisors are apparel, fast food, foreign language training, dry cleaning, hotels, and car rental services. Local franchises have been particularly successful in apparel, food, ice cream, "empanada" pastries, fitness/health clubs, and education. Coffee shops and stores are currently going through a growth stage, with local brands such as Havanna and Bonafide having more than 120 stores each. Starbucks entered the Argentine market in 2008, opening over 30+ stores since entrance. Other significant U.S. market players include Kodak Express, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy’s, Cartridge World, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Re-Max.

Franchise contracts are generally protected under the Argentine Commercial Code and are not governed by specific legislation. The scope of the service, commercial trade market/name, expertise, and shared production elements are covered by contractual obligations on both franchisor and franchisee. Elements of the contract include the license, methods/systems or proprietary information transferred to a franchisee, inputs supply, sales methods, quality standards, and ultimate control by franchisor of the contract elements.

Franchises have been successfully used in Argentina, but the obligations of the franchisor must be clearly established in the contract to avoid potential liabilities related to the operator, such as default, bankruptcy, etc. There are initiatives to advance a Franchising Bill to fully formalize the industry, but legal counsel should be sought prior to entering the Argentine marketplace and appointing a franchisee.
