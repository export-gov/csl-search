Additionally, ANMAT regulates and prohibits imports of certain toxic substances contained in products such as pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. The National Service of Agricultural Food Health and Quality (SENASA), provides information on import regulations for agricultural products.

Argentina bans imports of live ruminants and their meat due to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) concerns according to Resolution 799/2010 that replaces former Resolution 117/2002 an its amendments. Resolution 799/2010 defines the methodology to be followed for the risk assessment of importation of live animals, their reproductive material, and products and by-products of animal origin in relation to BSE occurrence.

Sweetbreads (thymus) were the highest valued and most competitive U.S. beef product exported to Argentina that was affected by the BSE beef ban. The trade constraint regarding the thymus sweetbread is an Argentine requirement that classifies thymus sweetbreads as high risk for BSE. SENASA published a draft regulation for comment in January 2010 that will amend 117/2002 and will require a risk assessment before allowing imports of sweetbreads and other animal products.
