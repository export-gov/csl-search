The passage of Leasing Law No. 25.248 in 2000 raised the stature of leasing as a financing option. Currently, leasing operations are mostly of equipment. Leasing activities increased approximately 30 percent year-on-year from 2011 to 2012, and industry experts expect this trend to continue evolving. Furthermore, leasing operations account for less than five percent of investment in Argentina, which represents a significant opportunity for growth. During 2012, there were approximately 20,000 leasing operations, amounting to roughly $1 billion. Some of the perceived advantages of leasing entail: installments that are fully deductible from capital gains taxes, no property taxes or taxes on interest, VAT applied proportionately on installments rather than up front, and accelerated depreciation. However, foreign firms that wish to lease equipment to Argentine customers must do so via an Argentine registered subsidiary. Some foreign firms that engage in leasing via their Argentine subsidiaries have reported difficulties in repatriating lease payments to their foreign parent firm.
