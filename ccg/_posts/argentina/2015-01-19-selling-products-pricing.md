U.S. exporters should take into account that locally manufactured products and those products imported from other MERCOSUR countries will have a price and duty advantage. Customized services and products can still charge price premiums demanded by the affluent population in certain geographical areas. Argentina has been traditionally characterized by high prices, high costs, and relatively low competitive pressures due to highly concentrated markets. Please refer to the “Trade Regulations and Standards” guide for more information on import tariffs.
