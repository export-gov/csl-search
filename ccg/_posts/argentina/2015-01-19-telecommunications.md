Cell and smart phones are widely used and available. There is also a wide range of cable television channels available, including CNN International, _CNN en Español_, FOX, WB, Sony, MTV, and channels from Brazil, Chile, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere. Cable and satellite TV are very common.
