Projected growth for 2013 and beyond has been affected by Government regulations limiting imports and access to foreign exchange.

The Argentine agricultural machinery market is growing as a result of good rain in 2012 following drought in 2011 and solid international commodity prices. The agricultural machinery market is projected at $1 billion in 2013. The agricultural machinery and equipment industry in Argentina is long-established and was one of the first industries to develop because of agricultureâ€™s historically predominant role in the Argentine economy. Domestic production of agricultural machinery and equipment accounts for between 15 and 35 percent of the total market, depending on the product. There are approximately 130 manufacturers of a wide variety of machinery and many of them rely on imported key parts and components that present opportunities for U.S. suppliers. Distribution agreements, joint-ventures with domestic manufacturers and licensing are potential options, but U.S. firms should choose their partners carefully given that protection of intellectual property is a continuing challenge and some local Argentine firms have been known to copy patented foreign designs.
