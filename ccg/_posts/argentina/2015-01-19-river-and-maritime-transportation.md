Almost 70 percent of Argentinaâ€™s foreign trade is carried by ship, and about 80 percent of the import/export transactions are carried out through the ports of Buenos Aires and La Plata. The waterways on the Parana and Uruguay rivers are well-dredged and maintained. These rivers link the port of Buenos Aires to internal Argentine ports, as well as to ports in Paraguay and Brazil.
