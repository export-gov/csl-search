The [Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)](http://www.opic.gov/) offers assistance to U.S. private investors in the form of political risk insurance, as well as loans and loan guarantees for their direct investment in Argentina. OPIC's main programs are:

_Investment Insurance_: Provides insurance against the risks of currency inconvertibility, expropriation, and the loss of assets or income caused by political violence. Coverage is available for new investments and for investments to expand or modernize existing operations.

_Investment Programs_: Medium- to long-term financing for sound overseas investment projects is made available through loan guarantees and direct loans. Loan guarantees generally range from $10 million to $75 million, and direct loans generally range from $2 million to $10 million. Direct loans are reserved for projects involving small businesses or cooperatives. OPIC's financing commitment may range from 50 percent of total project costs for new ventures to up to 75 percent for expansions of existing operations with maturities of five to twelve years (and in some cases longer).
