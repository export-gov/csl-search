Opportunities within the market for U.S. exports include middle and high-end technology products that do not compete with locally manufactured ones, among which are electro diagnostic equipment, ultrasound equipment, and other instruments and apparatus. There may also be potential in the market for implants, stents, cardiac valves, pacemakers, and specialized disposables.
