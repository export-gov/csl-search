Medical technology and products developed and produced in the United Sates are highly regarded in Argentina. Medical products that cannot be manufactured locally continue to present strong opportunities for U.S. exporters, particularly when offering high quality products at competitive prices. In any case, product potential should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits. (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
