There are two types of traditional sales channels in Argentina. One is through large-scale retailers with a defined but limited share of the market. The other is through the many specialized retailers that seek to protect their niches.

The food retail market is loosely separated into three categories: traditional "mom and pop" stores scattered throughout local neighborhoods, self-service mini-markets and drugstores, and the supermarkets and hypermarkets. Consumers prefer hypermarkets and supermarkets for lower prices on weekly and monthly purchases.
