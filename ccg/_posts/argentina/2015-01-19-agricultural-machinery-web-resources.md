The best way to familiarize a potential local partner or buyer to a U.S. company’s product line is to exhibit in local trade shows, the largest one being Expoagro ([http://expoagro.com.ar/site/en/index.php](http://expoagro.com.ar/site/en/index.php)).

Advertising of specific products, parts, and equipment is normally done through web-based specialized publications:

•	_Agritotal - Revista Chacra (Spanish)_: [http://www.agritotal.com/](http://www.agritotal.com/)

•	_Infortambo (Spanish)_: [http://www.infortambo.com.ar/](http://www.infortambo.com.ar/)

•	_Via Rural (Spanish)_: [http://www.viarural.com.ar/](http://www.viarural.com.ar/)

•	_Revista Super Campo_: [http://supercampo.perfil.com/](http://supercampo.perfil.com/)
