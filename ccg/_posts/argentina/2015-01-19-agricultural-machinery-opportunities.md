Products offering cost savings on the use of seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals are most in demand, especially those which incorporate a high level of nutrients in order to maintain yields and improve the quality of the products: information technology services for agriculture via wireless connections and Wi-Max networks; seeder pumps; GPS; data collection equipment for soil analysis, crop yields, remote sensing applications; and sprayer nozzles. Please note that used and remanufactured/reconditioned machinery and parts cannot be imported to Argentina.

However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
