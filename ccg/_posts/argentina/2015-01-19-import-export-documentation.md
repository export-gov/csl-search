**Maritime Shipments**

The following documents are required for all maritime shipments, regardless of value:

•	Commercial invoice (original and three copies)

•	Bill of lading (minimum of one negotiable copy for customs purposes)

•	Packing list (not generally required for bulk commodities or for articles that are identical in kind, characteristics, composition, weight, etc.)
•	Insurance certificate (if insurance coverage is purchased by the exporter)

**Air Cargo Shipments**

These documents are always required for air cargo shipments, regardless of value:

•	Commercial invoice (original and three copies)

•	Airway bill (number of copies depends on requirements of the importer and on the airline used)
•	Packing list.

Freight forwarding and/or agents' fees cannot be shown on airway bills on a freight collect basis; i.e. the fees must be prepaid.
