Irrigation Equipment: The Argentine market for irrigation systems has been growing in recent years due to the increased amount of Argentine farmland dedicated to row crops. Currently, 3.6 million acres, or less than five percent of farmland, is under irrigation. Specialists indicate that at least 20 percent of total farmland could benefit from irrigation. The U.S. dominates imports in this sector, accounting for over 50 percent of imports.

Parts and Components: This subsector currently represents approximately 10 percent of the annual sales value of tractors and harvesters, with a large number of small Argentine producers of agricultural implements and some domestic production of tractors and combines. Gradually, Argentine agricultural producers are integrating technologies that help to minimize use of agricultural inputs while not reducing yield and draw on foreign suppliers for key components. This offers opportunities in technologies ranging from precision agriculture to key components for domestically manufactured equipment such as self-propelled sprayers.
