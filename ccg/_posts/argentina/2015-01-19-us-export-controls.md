The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which regulates the export and re-export of most commercial items. The items that BIS regulates are often referred to as “dual use” since they have both commercial and military applications. Please note that even commercial items without an obvious military use may be subject to the EAR. Items with an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that are regulated for Chemical and Biological Weapons (CB), National Security (NS), Missile Technology (MT), Regional Stability (RS) or Crime Control (Column 1 or 2) purposes require a license from BIS for export to Russia.

Further information on export controls is available at: [http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm](http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm).

BIS has developed a list of "red flags", or warning signs, intended to discover possible violations of the EAR. These are posted at:

[http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oee/compliance/23-compliance-a-training/51-red-flag-indicators](http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oee/compliance/23-compliance-a-training/51-red-flag-indicators)

Also, BIS has "Know Your Customer" guidance at:

If there is reason to believe a violation is taking place or has occurred, report it to the Department of Commerce by calling the 24-hour hotline at 1(800) 424-2980, or via the confidential lead page at: [https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/component/rsform/form/14-reporting-violations-form?task=forms.edit](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/component/rsform/form/14-reporting-violations-form?task=forms.edit). The EAR does not control all goods, services, and technologies. Other U.S. Government agencies regulate more specialized exports. For example, the U.S. Department of State has authority over defense articles and defense services. A list of other agencies involved in export control can be found on the BIS web site or in Supplement No. 3 to Part 730 of the EAR, which is available on the Government Printing Office Web site at [http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html](http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html).
