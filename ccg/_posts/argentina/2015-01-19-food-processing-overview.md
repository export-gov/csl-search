The U.S. continues to hold its position as the largest supplier of food processing equipment to Argentina. Although local production figures are almost non-existent, imports are estimated to account for 70 to 85 percent of the total market. Imports peaked 2011 and while they decreased in 2012 due to overall economic conditions, imports from the U.S. regained market share. Imports are expected to return to moderate growth levels during 2013 and beyond.
