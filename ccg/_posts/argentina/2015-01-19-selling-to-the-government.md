Decrees 436/2000,1023/2001 and 1818/2006 together with Resolution 515/2000 establish the rules applicable to federal government purchases. They can be downloaded (in Spanish) from the following web site: [https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/](https://www.argentinacompra.gov.ar/).

These regulations apply to all federal public agencies (including autonomous or decentralized institutions), but exclude federal banks. They also establish the amounts determining the selection process. Government purchases of less than AR$75,000 undergo direct purchase. Purchases between AR$75,000 and AR$300,000 undergo private bidding, but purchases over that amount must have an open public tender.

Advertising and publishing procedure terms apply regarding important contracts in main publications and Internet sites such as the National Contracting Office (Oficina Nacional de Contrataciones - ONC) as well as in the Official Bulletin and publications of suppliers associations. Requirements for first-time sales to the government depend on the type of provider. Information should be submitted in writing and in the form of a diskette.

The ONC is the agency supervising procurement for the National Public Administration. This Office is part of the Secretariat of Public Management, Chief of Cabinet.

Most provincial governments have their own web sites with procurement information. Uni√≥n Argentina de Proveedores del Estado (UAPE) is a prominent NGO looking out for the interests of companies participating in national, provincial, and municipal procurements. UAPE has a database of government procurements. More information can be found at [http://www.uape.org.ar/](http://www.uape.org.ar/).
