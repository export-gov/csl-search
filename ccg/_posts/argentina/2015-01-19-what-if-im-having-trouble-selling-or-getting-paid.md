**How can the US Commercial Service help you?**

The US Commercial Service has offices throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and can help you through our advocacy support. We can help you resolve your investment and trade disputes with foreign firms, overcome trade barriers, bureaucratic problems, or unfair trade practices, enabling you to settle your differences through friendly negotiations and making sure that your company has the best possible chance to sell its US products and services in Latin America.

If you are bidding on an international tender and would like assistance, please go to our Advocacy Assistance website ([http://www.export.gov/advocacyassistance.html](http://www.export.gov/advocacyassistance.html)). The US Commercial Service's mission is not only to increase US exports, but also to defend US business interests overseas. If you are experiencing problems with foreign government authorities or with your Latin American business partners, please visit the [www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/](www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/) website which provides contact information for all of our offices throughout Latin America.
