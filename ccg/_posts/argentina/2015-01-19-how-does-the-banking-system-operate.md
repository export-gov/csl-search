In Argentina, Law No. 21,526 of 1977 governs banking activities. Under this law, Argentinaâ€™s Central Bank (BCRA) is the implementing authority and the regulatory body, which issues standards and controls activities of financial institutions included in the law (authorization and operating conditions within the banking industry; definition of permitted, prohibited and limited transactions; monetary controls; meeting certain operating ratios; information; accounting and control systems; dissolution and liquidation; etc.). In order to operate in Argentina, foreign banks must register with the BCRA and obtain appropriate authorization prior to engaging in banking activities in Argentina. In addition, there are minimum capital requirements for these entities to be allowed to do business.
