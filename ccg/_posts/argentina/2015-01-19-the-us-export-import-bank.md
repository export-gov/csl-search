The Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank is open for short and medium-term financing for U.S. exports only to private sector clients in Argentina. Long-term (15 years) financing is available for environmental projects on a case-by-case basis. Bank officials express optimism about Argentina and will continue to monitor the marketplace in order to consider future provisions of export financing for U.S. goods and services.

Ex-Im Bank will consider structured financing arrangements such as some project finance, asset-based aircraft leases, and other financing arrangements in key industries, such as mining, that offer a reasonable assurance of repayment, including reliable access to adequate foreign exchange. In addition, coverage under the Working Capital Guarantee Program may be available for a transaction that is supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit issued by a bank and/or due from a buyer located in a country where Ex-Im Bank is open without restrictions for short-term transactions.

Visit the Ex-Im Internet site at [http://www.exim.gov/](http://www.exim.gov/) for 24-hour access to Ex-Im and its programs, or call their toll free telephone number (800) 565-EXIM.
