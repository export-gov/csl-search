The basic legislation affecting import and export transactions is contained in the Customs Code (Law 22,415), which came into force in September 1981. In 2010, MERCOSUR approved the so called MERCOSUR Customs Code to come into effect January 1, 2012, which now needs the approval of the Legislative branches of each of the four members.
 
In 2006, there was a significant increase in the regulation of goods and capital flows. The most significant changes include product-specific export restrictions; variations in tariffs on key export commodities; the extension of an Argentina/Brazil automotive managed trade regime that was due to expire in 2006; the implementation of government-promoted private sector agreements to limit intra-MERCOSUR trade in sensitive sectors, including textiles and shoes, and more extensive regulations on capital movement.

While there is no legal prohibition against foreign companies repatriating profits, GOA regulations implemented in November 2011 mandating that firms receive permission from Argentine Tax and Customs Authority (AFIP) in order to exchange local currency into foreign exchange, serve as a de-facto control on the ability of foreign firms to repatriate profits. Meanwhile, export proceeds must be repatriated to Argentina. Repatriation deadlines vary based on product categories. These stipulations could change based on economic conditions.

Companies located in Argentina wishing to import must be registered in the National Registry of Importers and Exporters. Registration is free of charge and procedures are relatively simple.
