The bill of lading should be issued (at minimum) in one negotiable copy; additional negotiable copies may be required by the importer, bank, steamship line, or other interested party (follow instructions from the importer or those given in the letter of credit or other contractual arrangement). Bills of lading must indicate the weight and volume of each package, as well as the total weight and volume of the shipment. All bills of lading must also show the amount of freight and a statement "Freight Paid," or "Freight Payable at Destination" as appropriate.

The bill of lading must show the following:

•	Name of the ship

•	Name of the ship's captain

•	Port of registry and registered tonnage (weight and volume)

•	Name of the charter or the shipper

•	Name of the consignee (unless it is "to the bearer" or "to order")

•	Number of packages, and specific description of the contents, the quantity, quality and marks of the goods

•	Port of loading and unloading, with a declaration of the port of call, if any

•	Freight amount

•	Place, method and date of payment

•	Date of preparation of the document and signature of the captain and of the shipper (signature of the shipping company and shipper should be signed manually, facsimile signatures are not acceptable)

•	Container and seal number, and terms of shipment

•	Invoice number suggested
