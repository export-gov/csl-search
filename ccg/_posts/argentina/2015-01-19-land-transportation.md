Argentina stretches 4,000 km (2,500 mi.) from north to south, an expanse crossed by only a few major highways. Argentina's 208,350 km (129,462 mi.) road network carries 85 percent of domestic freight traffic. Argentina has over 35,000 km (21,000 mi.) of railroads, but quality and speed vary widely. In general, the rail network requires significant investment to bring it up to international standards of speed and reliability.
