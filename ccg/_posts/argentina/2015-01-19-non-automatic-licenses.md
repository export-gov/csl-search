The GOA recently abolished the non-automatic import license requirements for products to be imported into Argentina. Given that the new Permission to Import regime is applied to each shipment of all products and has a similar spirit to that of Non-Automatic Licenses, the Argentine Government decided to remove the non-automatic import license as a prerequisite to import the majority of products that required it.
