Visas are not required for U.S. citizens traveling to Argentina for up to 90 days of tourism or business, except holders of U.S. Diplomatic and Official passports. However, the Argentine Government implemented a reciprocal Visa Fee on all foreign nationals whose governments require visas of Argentines. This fee must be paid online at the Provincia Pagos website, before you board a flight for Argentina. Once paid, you must print out the receipt and present it to the Argentine immigration officer at the time of entry. Airlines will not allow you to board unless you present the receipt as proof of payment. The link to the site is: [http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm](http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm).

For American citizens, the fee is currently $160.00 and is valid for ten years and multiple entries into Argentina. Visitors may request an extension of stay up to 90 additional days from the Argentine Immigration Service at:
