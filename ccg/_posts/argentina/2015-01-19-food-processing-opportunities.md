While imports decreased in general in 2012, imports from the U.S. grew 22 percent, regaining their traditional market share. The food processing equipment market in Argentina relies heavily on imports by large domestic food processing companies and food exporters.

Argentina is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter, and the leader in soy oil and soy meal exports. It is also a top corn exporter. Expectations for record soybean and corn crops may continue to trigger investment in appropriate processing equipment.

Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America. U.S. products are often sought out, particularly in the higher-end technology segment. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
