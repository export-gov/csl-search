In cash payment conditions, when the cost of the domestic good is five (for small firms) to seven percent higher than the cost of the imported/foreign good, the contracting party should select the domestic good. In the case of deregulated markets, the contracting party should select the domestic goods when the value quoted is equal to or lower than that of the imported/foreign goods. This requirement applies only when the domestic goods meet all the requirements set forth in contracting documents and can fulfill expected functions (_id√©nticas o similares prestaciones_).
