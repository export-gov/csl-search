Distribution in Argentina tends to be radial, with all roads converging on the Port of Buenos Aires. This dates back to the turn of the century, when Argentina's rail and road systems were developed by the British to bring products to the Port of Buenos Aires to satisfy the foreign demand for commodities. The hub-oriented distribution approach used in the U.S. does not yet exist in Argentina.
