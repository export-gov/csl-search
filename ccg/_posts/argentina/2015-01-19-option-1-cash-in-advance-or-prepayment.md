**Comments:**

If Export Credit Insurance or alternative sources of financing are not options, cash in advance is likely the most prudent payment mechanism for a US exporter selling to a Latin American buyer:

1.	Who is a first time client;
2.	Who isn’t well known to the US Company;
3.	Who is financially weak;
4.	Who has a history of payment default;
5.	Who is operating under the foreign equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
