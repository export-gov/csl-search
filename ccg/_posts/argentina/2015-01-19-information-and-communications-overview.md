By 2011, Argentina was well along the path of developing its domestic industry in the software and IT services sectors. The software and computer services industry in Argentina has approximately 40,000 qualified workers spread among 1,000 companies that invoice around $1,600 million and $300 million in software and IT services exports. By the end of 2012, the industry employed nearly 67,000 workers and increased revenues to almost $3 billion, including more than $700 million in exports. CESSI, the Argentine Chamber of Software and IT Services Companies, projects 12 percent growth in 2013.

Argentina has one of the most developed broadband markets in Latin America, with some of the fastest and least expensive plans. At 14.3 percent at year-end 2012, penetration is among the highest in the region. The main broadband technologies are cable modem and ADSL. Fixed wireless and satellite broadband account for about 1 percent of the market, while FttH is just starting. Broadband demand is expected to continue rising, particularly in areas outside of Buenos Aires.

Four main factors will keep demand for software and IT services high in 2013:

•	the majority of the systems installed need upgrading

•	the growth of Internet access (fixed and mobile)

•	the increasing complexity and convergence of technologies

•	highly educated and tech-savvy population
