2012 market share: United States: 25%; Germany: 12%; Japan: 12%; China: 11%; Brazil 3%

Medical equipment imports during 2011 experienced an exceptional surge. While imports decreased in general in 2012, imports from the U.S. grew slightly. The United States continues to be the leading supplier of imported medical products and currently holds 26 percent market share, particularly in high-technology products. Imports in the overall medical product sector have been estimated to traditionally account for around 70 percent of the total market.

Imports of medical products must be performed by an importer registered with the ANMAT (the Argentine equivalent to the FDA) as a frequent importer of medical equipment.
