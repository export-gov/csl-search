**Comments:**

There are a number of development banks in Latin America. Many countries have both federally supported and state-level supported development banks. The attractiveness of these loans varies from country to country, so we recommend contacting us at [www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/](www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/) for more information on a particular development bank.
