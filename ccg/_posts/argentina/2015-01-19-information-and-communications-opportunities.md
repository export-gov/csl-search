The following main factors will keep demand for IT hardware, software, and services high, with increased competition in 2013:

•	new investments in the country in a number of industries (e.g., tourism)

•	new mobile number portability law

•	tendering of remaining frequencies to offer mobile services and satellite TV services

•	nationwide extension of fiber optic lines under the Argentina Conectada program

In the telecom sector, investments in 2013 will focus on four areas: deployment and enhancement of the cellular GSM network (3G+), expansion of broadband Internet access (via ADSL, cable modem, Wi-fi, Wi-Max, 3G USB modems, and smart phones), expansion of data transmission/broadband and content over cellular networks, and the continuing migration to IP networks (NGN) and triple play.

Argentina continues to present many opportunities to U.S. exporters. However, the Argentine Government has imposed import and foreign exchange controls potentially affecting all exports to Argentina regardless of origin or product category. It is important for current and would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customers have received all the necessary permits to import the goods and to acquire the foreign exchange to pay for the goods prior to shipment. (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
