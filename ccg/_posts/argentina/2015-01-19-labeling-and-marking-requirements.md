Under Argentine law 22,802/83, the Bureau of Trade Regulation (_Dirección de Lealtad Comercial_) of the Ministry of Economy’s Secretariat of Industry, establishes labeling requirements for products in Argentina. The law requires that product labels bear all the information that the customer needs, and that the information is true and valid. The Secretariat of Industry in the Ministry of Economy ensures transparency in all business transactions and enforces the labeling regime.

Law 22,802 of 1983, known as the Merchandise Marking Act, supersedes Law 11,275 of 1923. The current law states the general and basic labeling requirements for domestic or imported products, as follows:

Article 1: - All packaged products sold in Argentina will bear the following information on a printed label in a visible manner on the package or container:

a)	Name (description of product)

b)	Country of origin

c)	Quality, purity, or blending description

d)	Net weight


All non-packaged products commercialized in country will have to comply with requirements a), b) and c), as stated above.

In some cases, the Government Regulatory bodies of each industry provide information on the corresponding labeling requirements.

For example, for information on labeling requirements for the medical industry, hygiene and food products etc., the ANMAT (the equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the regulatory body of the Ministry of Health) provides additional information to the general rules for specific products.
