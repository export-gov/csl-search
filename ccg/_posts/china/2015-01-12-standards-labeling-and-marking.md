Based on the Food Safety Law which went into effect June 1, 2009, imported pre-packed food shall have labels and instructions in Chinese. The labels and instructions shall conform to this law, other relevant laws, administrative regulations and national food safety standards of China, and state the place of origin as well as the name, address and contact information of the domestic agent.

As noted in the Product and Certification Section above, products requiring the CCC mark, in addition to undergoing an application and testing process, must have the mark physically applied on products before entering or being sold in China.

Labeling and marking requirements are mostly made by different industry authorities. However, all products sold in China must be marked in the Chinese language. The State Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) requires imported and exported (but not domestic) food items such as candy, wine, nuts, canned food, and cheese to have labels verified and products tested for quality before a good can be imported or exported. According to the Food Labeling Standards of China, imported foods shall have clear markings that indicate the country of origin, in addition to the name and address of the general distributor registered in the country.
