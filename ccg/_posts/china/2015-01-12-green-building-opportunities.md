According to Liu Zhifeng, Director of China Real Estate Research Committee, in the next decade, China's real estate construction market has great potential due to economic development and urbanization. In the next 10 years, China's urbanization will reach 65-70 percent and the urban resident population will increase by another 300 million. Other than the development of commercial, tourism, senior housing and industrial real estate, China still needs to complete 800 million square meters of residential housing in order to accommodate the urban population. This should take another 10 years. China's 12th FYP indicated that 36 million apartments will be built. China also plans to invest $158.7 billion on "Nation City and Town Sewage Treatment and Renewable Construction Plan."
