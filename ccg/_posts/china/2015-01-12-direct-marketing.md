Direct selling is a type of business model involving the recruitment of direct marketing sales agents or promoters and the selling of products to end-consumers outside fixed business locations or outlets.

As part of China's WTO commitment, the Chinese Government agreed to allow market access for "wholesale or retail trade services away from a fixed location." These new regulations are quite restrictive, however. Multi-level marketing (MLM) organizations are characterized as illegal pyramids, compensation is capped at 30 percent based on personal sales, and language exists that requires the construction of fixed location "service centers" in each area where sales occur. To obtain a direct sales license from the government, further barriers exist as evidenced by a three-year foreign experience rule, and a required RMB 20-100 million bond deposit, among other requirements. Several major international companies have had success in overcoming these barriers. Having said this, the Chinese Government is slow to approve direct-sales license applications for new entrants over the past few years. In general, the Chinese central government and the relevant authorities at central and local levels tend to heavily regulate and supervise this industry.
