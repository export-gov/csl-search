CS welcomes contact with American companies that aim to initiate or expand exports to the Chinese market. Two of the primary objectives of U.S. policy with regard to China are (a) creating jobs and growing the American economy by increasing exports, and (b) ensuring our companies' ability to compete on a level playing field. A company should visit China in order to gain a better perspective and understanding of its potential as a market. Given the size of China and its rapidly changing market, a visit to China can provide great insight into the country's business climate and its people. Chinese company representatives respect "face-to-face" meetings, which can demonstrate a U.S. company's commitment to working in China. Prospective exporters should note that China has many different regions and that each province has unique economic and social characteristics.

U.S. companies commonly use agents in China to initially create these relationships. Localized agents possess the knowledge and contacts to better promote U.S. products and break down institutional, language, and cultural barriers. CS in China offers a wide array of services to assist U.S. exporters in finding Chinese partners through a network of five Commercial Service posts in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Chengdu). They also have a partnership with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) to provide services in 14 other major cities in China. U.S. companies are strongly encouraged to carefully choose potential Chinese partners and take the time to fully understand their distributors, customers, suppliers, and advisors.
