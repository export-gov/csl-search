China is set to reduce its energy consumption and made carbon dioxide emissions a "binding goal" in its 12th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. Many provinces and cities have drafted their own enforcement plans; every city is planning to be an "eco-city" by not only retrofitting old buildings but also by building new low carbon buildings.
