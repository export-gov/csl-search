While China is one of the most promising global markets, it is also one of the most challenging environments for American companies. Many U.S. companies are able to profitably enter and operate in the Chinese market, but each year a large number of firms face serious difficulties that frequently result in costly and disruptive local business disputes.

A large number of these disputes might have been successfully avoided through due diligence. The primary causes of commercial disputes between Chinese and American companies include breach of contractual payment obligations, irregularities in accounting practices, financial mismanagement, undisclosed debt, and the struggle for control within joint ventures. These problems can be minimized by investigating the financial standing and reputation of local companies before signing contracts or entering into a partnership agreement.

Both U.S. and Chinese service providers with offices in China conduct due diligence investigations. The fees charged by these companies should typically be considered a worthwhile investment to ensure that the local customer or partner is financially sound and reliable. As a part of the overall due diligence process, CS is able to assist American companies to evaluate potential business partners through its International Company Profile service. As a general rule of thumb, CS in China strongly encourages more due diligence in China than one would typically need in the United States. CS also supplies a number of useful reference documents to help identify and minimize business risks in China.
