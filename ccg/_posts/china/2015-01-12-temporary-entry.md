**1. Trade Shows & Exhibitions**

Participants of trade shows and exhibitions can come into China on tourist visas and travel in-country. Notebook computers, cameras and portable printers can be brought into China as personal belongings. Business firms seeking to bring in exhibits and items for display should consult with customs authorities or the show organizers for regulation on the procedures and to obtain copies of appropriate forms.

**2. Temporary Entry**

Goods imported in China for display or demonstration at trade shows and exhibitions are exempt from Customs duty, provided they are re-exported within six months. The time for re-export may be extended with Customs approval. The exhibition organizer must obtain advance approval from Customs, provide certain shipping documents and a list of items to be exhibited, and coordinate with Customs officials. Customs may sometimes request a guarantee in the form of a deposit or letter.

A local sponsor with authority to engage in foreign trade may sponsor small exhibitions or technical seminars, requiring less than 1,000 square meters in exhibition space. Customs will handle the tariff exemption formalities based upon a guarantee of re-export that is signed between the sponsor and the foreign party.

Food and beverage exhibition "not-for-sale" sample-entry rules are not clearly defined and appear capriciously applied. U.S. exhibitors should contact the exhibition organizers to determine their liabilities regarding sample entries for such events before registering to participate, to obtain a clearer understanding of exhibition-related expenses.

Some exhibits or samples imported under the temporary not-for-sale regulations may be sold after the trade event is completed, in which case the duties owed on these items are levied by Customs.

According to the Corporation for International Business, the ATA Carnet Issuing authority in China no longer requires a cover letter along with the carnet presented to Chinese customs inspectors. The CIB is an ATA Carnet Service Provider of the U.S. Council for International Business (USCIB), New York City. USCIB is the Guaranteeing and Issuing Association for the ATA Carnet in the United States, under appointment of the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. Interested firms can contact the CIB by sending an e-mail to [carnets@atacarnet.com](mailto:carnets@atacarnet.com) or by calling the CIB Carnet hotline (800 ATA-2900).

Companies are advised that freight forwarders will help to prepare a declaration form and Chinese Customs requests the model and serial numbers for high-value exhibits. Requirements may differ for types of products to be imported. In addition, fumigation is required for all wooden packing materials, in accordance with IPPC standards, and must bear the IPPC symbol.
