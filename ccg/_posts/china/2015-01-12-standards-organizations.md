Technical Committees (TC) developing national or GB standards must be accredited by SAC. These TCs are comprised of members from government agencies, private industry associations, companies (sometimes local branches of foreign companies but often with limited voting rights), and academia.

Other government agencies, such as the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, can approve and promulgate technical regulations that may reference voluntary standards, rendering them mandatory.
