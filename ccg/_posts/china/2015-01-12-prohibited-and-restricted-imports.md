The following items are prohibited from entering China: arms, ammunition, and explosives of all kinds; counterfeit currencies and counterfeit negotiable securities; printed matter, magnetic media, films, or photographs which are deemed to be detrimental to the political, economic, cultural and moral interests of China; lethal poisons; illicit drugs; disease-carrying animals and plants; foods, medicines, and other articles coming from disease-stricken areas; old/used garments; and local currency (RMB). Food items containing certain food colorings and additives deemed harmful to human health by the Ministry of Health are also barred entry.

In addition, rules went into effect in June 1999 which further restrict or prohibit the importation of certain commodities related to the processing trade. The "Catalogue of Commodities Which are Restricted or Prohibited from Importing for Use in the Processing Trade" is designed to shift the direction of China's processing trade toward handling commodities with higher technological content and greater value-added potential. The catalogue identifies the following "prohibited commodities": used garments; used publications with licentious content; radioactive or harmful industrial waste; junk cars, used automobiles or components; seeds, seedlings, fertilizers, feed, additives, or antibiotics used in the cultivation or breeding of any export commodity. The catalogue lists seven general types of "restricted commodities": raw materials for plastics, polyester sections, raw materials for chemical fibers, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and some steel products. This list has been updated yearly since 1999, with the last one published in 2010: ([http://cys.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/al/201009/20100907166511.html](http://cys.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/al/201009/20100907166511.html)).

However, these reports only show updates and do not reflect the final list. U.S. firms should contact the China General Administration of Customs for guidance regarding the import of any of these products. (See below for contact information)
