**How to Establish a Representative Office in China**

Note: Regulations in China change frequently. While the information below is current at the time of publication, we highly recommend that companies engage competent professional service providers to assist in this process. Second, in the last few years many companies have opted for a wholly foreign owned consulting or service enterprise rather than a representative office, as this offers more flexibility and allows invoicing and collection of RMB payments.

A Representative Office (RO) must consist of no more than 4 representatives (including Chief Representative) and they may not be engaged in any profit-making activities. RO's can only engage in market research and investigation, promotional activities of products and services, liaison for the purposes of selling products or services, domestic procurement or domestic investment. The parent company must actually sign sales contracts.

**Representative Office Establishment Application Process**

Applications for most industry representative offices can be applied for directly at the Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC) in the locality where the proposed representative office is to be established. If a company's industry is designated "special," the AIC office will direct the firm to MOFCOM, and the company will register with MOFCOM instead of AIC. All Foreign Representatives must register with a RO within 6 months of entry. Those who have not obtained approval or have not gone through the procedures for registration shall not be permitted to undertake business operations for the home office.

The applicant or agent must submit the following documentation on behalf of the investor:

* Application letter signed by the Chairman of the Board or the General Manager. The application letter should contain, in part, the following: a description of the company's history, business and scope; the names of the Chairman of the Board, the General Manager and directors; the names of its major trading partners in China; its business volume; the proposed name of the representative office; the purpose for setting up the representative office and the scope of its activities; the duration of the office and its chief representative.
* Head office incorporation documents and a brief description of company. Head office incorporation documents include certified copies of the company's business registration certificate, the certificate of incorporation, the memoranda and articles of association, etc.
* Original bank reference letter attesting to the company's financial standing.	
* Letter from U.S. state of incorporation's Department of State, notarized by Chinese embassy/consulate, affirming that the foreign enterprise is a company in good standing.
* A letter appointing the chief representative to the representative office as well as the chief representative's resume showing his/her work experience and educational/professional qualifications, copies of his/her identification, passport and photos.
* A copy of the lease agreement for the representative office's premises from an approved unit (e.g., a hotel or commercial building, etc.).
* If the application is approved, an approval permit is normally issued to the representative office within one month after submission of the application. Having obtained the approval permit and business registration certificate from MOFCOM or the Administration for Industry and Commerce, other post registration formalities include: registering with the tax bureau, opening a bank account, completing a residence application with the with the local Public Security Bureau, applying to the Customs Administration for permission to import office equipment and daily necessities for use by the representative office and its personnel, appointing a Foreign Enterprise Employment Agent to recruit local Chinese employees, etc.

The registration of a representative office is required in order to lawfully employ Chinese nationals, to open a bank account or to use business cards that identify the company's presence in China. Additionally, the company's representative would be unable to obtain a multiple entry visa or legally rent an apartment without a commercial domicile registration booklet. This booklet is obtainable only after the registration of the representative office is complete. The employment of Chinese nationals as employees is normally facilitated with the assistance of a local foreign enterprise employment agent. These agencies handle the process of establishing the proper protocol for employing and paying local employees.

No one may be a Representative of a RO if:

* Sentenced to a criminal penalty for committing crimes detrimental to national security or public welfare of the People's Republic of China.
* If formerly the individual was deregistered, or whose registration was withdrawn or that was ordered closed by relevant authorities due to illegal activities that were detrimental to the national security or public welfare of the PRC in the last 5 years.

**Renewal**

Representative offices must submit annual reports to SAIC or AIC between March 1st and June 30th of each year with all proper documentation required.
