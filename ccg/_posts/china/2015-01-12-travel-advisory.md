The threat level for all China posts is considered low for crime and medium for terrorism.

**For the most up-to-date information related to traveling and living in China, please see the Department of State’s Country Specific Information on China at [http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1089.html](http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1089.html).**

China experiences a moderate rate of crime. **To reach the police in China, dial “110,” the local equivalent of 911. **Recent assaults at nightclubs and bars highlight the need to check local expatriate publications when planning outings. Pickpockets are particularly active in crowded markets and foreigners are often sought out as primary targets. Foreigners have often had bags or backpacks stolen when they set them down momentarily in a shop or put them on a chair in a restaurant; avoid keeping your passport in a bag. Thefts from taxis have also become more common and travelers are especially urged to hold purses or computer bags and to be sure drivers are not given the opportunity to leave with the traveler's luggage in the car or trunk. Petty theft from hotel rooms is uncommon but visitors are advised not to leave valuables lying loose or unattended in their rooms. Use safe deposit boxes or safes in rooms, or at the front desk, where provided. Use caution if approached by individuals purporting to be English-language or art students, and avoid sellers of pirated or fake products. These transactions are illegal and should be avoided.

Americans arriving without valid passports and Chinese visas are not permitted to enter China and may also be subject to fines. Visitors traveling to China on a single entry visa should be reminded that trips to Hong Kong or Macau Special Administrative Regions are treated as a visit outside Mainland China. If the traveler tries to return to Mainland China after a visit to one of these two destinations but only has a single entry visa, they will be denied entry. Visitors facing this dilemma should apply for a new visa at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the China Travel Service in Hong Kong to re-enter China. Transit through China without a visa is permitted in some circumstances but to avoid problems, check your itinerary and the most recent Chinese visa regulations to be sure your trip meets the regulations. Recent travel advisories and other useful information can be found on the U.S. State Department's travel website: [http://travel.state.gov/](http://travel.state.gov/).
