China's safety and security market exceeded $4.12 billion in 2011. As one of the world's fastest growing economies, China is undertaking numerous, large-scale projects including airports, sports stadiums, and metro systems that will require extensive security systems. In addition, municipalities are installing emergency response systems to improve security and bolster response times. On a consumer level, China's growing middle class is demanding high-quality, residential security equipment and services. Before selling in China, U.S. exporters need to be aware of Chinese certification requirements, as well as potential U.S. export controls. Overall, the sector is expected to maintain rapid growth and create export opportunities by expanding to an estimated $8.5 billion by 2015.
