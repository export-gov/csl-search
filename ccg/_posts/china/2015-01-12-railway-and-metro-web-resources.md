**American Rail Working Group (ARWG)**
The U.S. Embassy Commercial Section in Beijing launched an American Rail Working Group (ARWG) in January 2009 to strengthen public-private cooperation in the rail sector. The ARWG features 34 U.S. company members, and benefits from close relationships with the Chinese Ministry of Railway (MOR), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Rail Administration (FRA), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), U.S. State Department and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The group meets regularly in Beijing as well as via conference call. New company members are welcome to join.
