Brazil has numerous international and domestic airports, and American, Delta, TAM, and United offer direct flights between Brazil and the U.S., with Azul having just announced that flights to the U.S. will begin shortly. The countryâ€™s taxi services run very well, though U.S. citizens are recommended, for safety reasons, to meet one at a taxi stand or to call a radio-dispatched taxi, not to simply hail a taxi on the street. Public transportation, such as busses and subways, is also available, though in major metropolitan areas, it can often be unsafe.
