The use of social media is exploding in Brazil. It is the third largest market for Facebook, the fifth for Twitter, and first for LinkedIn with 6 million professional users. The Brazilian mobile consumer is eager to play games and use apps. Apple opened its first store in Rio de Janeiro at the end of 2013 and intends to open more stores in the largest cities of Brazil. The Apple App Store is already popular in Brazil; its year-on-year revenue growth outpaced that of the U.S. App Store. Brazilian app sales grew 83% in the last year, vs. 44% growth in the U.S. Brazil ranks sixth worldwide for App Store revenue growth.

Data cost prices are dropping in Brazil, as carriers offer competitive pricing plans. With prepaid plans as the most popular model, the major carriers are offering data plans from 20 to 25 cents per day. Some carriers are even offering no-charge access to data-heavy services like mobile video streaming. Thanks to government support in the form of auctions that encourage telecom carriers to purchase 4G bandwidth at competitive prices, Brazil is laying the groundwork for widespread 4G access. All four of Brazilâ€™s major telecom companies obtained licenses for 4G high-speed Internet capabilities in the recent auction. Over the long run, these telecoms companies are expected to offer 4G in all Brazilian cities with a population of 100,000 or more by the end of 2016.

Brazil is developing the conditions to have a dominant mobile market: the government is supporting new initiatives, important OEMs have plants in the country, and the consumer base is massive. As its place in the global mobile market matures over the next few years, developers, entrepreneurs and investors would be wise to obtain a stake in this mobile frontier before the competitive landscape becomes saturated.
