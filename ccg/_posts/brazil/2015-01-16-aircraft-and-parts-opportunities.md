The worldwide trend of airlines replacing larger jets with smaller designs that can fly more efficiently should help sustain Embraer’s role as leader in this market segment, thereby presenting good opportunities to U.S. aircraft parts and component manufacturers. Embraer imports about 50% of its components from U.S. suppliers.

According to the Brazilian Airlines Association (ABEAR), annual demand for air passenger transportation is currently estimated at 113 million, an expansion of 15% over 2012; and is expected to reach 211 million by 2020. Although the country boasts one of the world’s youngest aircraft fleets with an average age of just 6.7 years, significant investments will need to be made in order to meet the rapidly expanding demand. ABEAR’s study indicates that by 2020, Brazil will need to add 526 airplanes to its current fleet of 450.
