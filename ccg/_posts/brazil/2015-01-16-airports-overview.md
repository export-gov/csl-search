Along with the growth of Brazil’s economy, business travel and tourism have also grown substantially in the last few years. Increasing disposable income and growth of the middle class have signaled new opportunities for outbound tourism services, notably in domestic travel. In this context, decision-makers in Brazil have come to realize the need to increase capacity and undertake modernization projects in the country’s airports.

Brazil’s main airports are operating above their capacity limits. From 2003 until 2010, the number of passengers more than doubled (+117%). Investments made by Infraero, the federal agency in charge of airport operations, have not matched these ever increasing passenger numbers. Almost all major airports in Brazil are regarded as having reached a critical level in terms of average occupation, and it is clear that large amounts of capital must be invested quickly.

The Government of Brazil (GOB) estimates that investments of R$7.8 billion (approximately US$3.9 billion) are needed to upgrade the nation’s 13 busiest airports. This amount far exceeds the average annual investments made during the entire previous decade. Given the size of the challenge, the government decided to open the sector to public-private sector partnerships (PPPs).

On February 6, 2012, long-term concessions for three important airports were granted to private investors: Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo, Viracopos International Airport in Campinas and Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport in Brasília. On November 22, 2013, private investors were awarded concessions at two other major airports: Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro and Confins Airport in Belo Horizonte.

With five important airports partially privatized and master planning currently underway, the airport industry is potentially very attractive for U.S. suppliers of a wide-range of airport- related technologies and services. Additional rounds of PPPs in the airport sector should be expected starting in 2015, after this year’s presidential elections.
