Brazil is open to and encourages foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Brazil was the sixth largest destination for global FDI flows in 2013. New FDI into Brazil reached approximately USD 64 billion in 2013 and Brazil typically receives close to half of South Americaâ€™s total incoming FDI. The United States is a major foreign investor in Brazil; according to the Central Bank of Brazil, the United States had the highest stock of FDI in Brazil as of 2010, with $104 billion. While Brazil is generally considered a friendly environment for foreign investment, complex tax, local content, and regulatory requirements exist. In most cases, these impediments apply without discrimination to both foreign and domestic firms. The Government of Brazil (GOB) generally makes no distinction between foreign and national capital in cases of direct investment.

The Brazilian economy disappointed in 2013 with a meager 2.5 percent GDP growth, and market participants surveyed by the Central Bank of Brazil expect just 1.7 percent in 2014. Medium - and long-term prospects remain favorable, however, supported by strong domestic demand, global demand for commodity exports, a growing middle class, anticipated investments in infrastructure and development of offshore oil reserves, and prudent macroeconomic policies.
