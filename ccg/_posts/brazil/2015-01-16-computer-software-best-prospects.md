There is an increasing number of companies seeking information and knowledge on _cloud computing_. Demand for international collaboration, security, CRM, storage, and productivity will accelerate in the coming years. Virtualization and consolidation of infrastructure investment will continue as a priority in business. New solutions will lead to a profound change in the operation and delivery of IT solutions as suppliers will release specific and targeted offers for the cloud environment in 2014, with the rapid proliferation of Platforms as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It is expected that the IT market related to _cloud computing_ will reach US$560 million and investments in Big Data will reach US$394 million with a special focus on training.

Mobile data will also continue to grow at exponential rates. Some service solutions carriers will grow 4G-based solutions, which will make expansion of the mobile network critical. Data Centers will modernize or increase their current capacity in the coming years, and “Big Data” may become the challenge for solutions providers. Telecom companies are already using B/OSS (Business/Operations Support Systems) software solutions to help increase profitability, while simultaneously optimizing development and deployment costs. The well-developed financial sector seeks cyber-security solutions to prevent electronic fraud.

The demand for telecommunications software is expected to grow as a result of the convergence of data, voice, and conventional and mobile telecommunication. The most significant trend in this sector is the increase of data communication in mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Continued growth is expected over the next few years.

The current trend in Brazil is for consolidation of technologies for IT, infrastructure, network and telecommunications. In this regard, as Brazilian IT companies mature, they are attracting the interest of competitors and capital investment funds.

Within the software segment, 45% of the market represents purchases of enterprise applications such as CRM, ERP or SCM solutions; while systems infrastructure solutions, such as platforms for administrating and running software assets, contribute 36%.

With the expansion of broadband in Brazil, E-commerce is becoming part of the daily routine of Brazilian companies. The sectoris expected to grow 35% this year, and it is expected to double by 2017, reaching sales of US$25 billion.

Within the last decade, more than 30% of the population joined the middle class, a group with better access to information and consumer products than ever before. It is projected that by 2015, more than three million homes will obtain their first computer and the number of households with at least one computer should exceed 30 million. The number of notebooks is greater than those of desktops in the Brazilian market. The demand will motivate the launch of more specific software applications.
