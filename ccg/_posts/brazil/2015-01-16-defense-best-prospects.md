The 2014 draft budget law foresees R$72.8 billion, approximately US$31 billion for the defense sector. From this total, 73% are for expenses with staff. The Brazilian Navy requested R$12 billion (US$5.2 billion) for its programs in 2014, but expects to receive R$5.5 billion. The Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Air Force anticipate R$5.8 billion and R$4.8 billion, respectively.

According to the Defense Articulation and Equipment Plan (_Plano de Articulação e Equipamento de Defesa_; PAED), the Ministry of Defense has identified and is coordinating the following priority projects for the armed forces:

Brazilian Navy: The Brazilian Navy has seven priority projects to be implemented by 2031, valued at R$211 Billion (US$119 Billion). The most important navy opportunities for U.S. companies include:

* Navy Nuclear Program: In addition to the continued development of Brazil’s nuclear submarine program, the Navy’s program also includes: analysis and development of the nuclear fuel cycle in submarines, certification of the Navy’s nuclear-electric energy generation lab (LABGENE), construction of a prototype reactor, and an upgrade to the Navy’s Technological Center in São Paulo

* Navy Modernization Program: This is an extensive program that includes the gradual replacement of naval air and sea combat platforms. Some of the projects include:

    + Submarine Development Program (_Programa de Desenvolvimento de Submarinos_; PROSUB), program to develop non-nuclear submarines

    + Surface Vessel Procurement Program (_Programa de Obtenção de Meios de Superfície_; PROSUPER), a program for five, 1,800-ton ocean patrol vessels, five 6,000-ton frigates and a single support vessel, all of which are to be built locally in cooperation with Brazilian companies according to Brazilian law and offset requirements

* Amazon Blue Management System (Sistema de Gerenciamento da Amazônia Azul; SisGAAz), a Navy program for the surveillance and monitoring of Brazilian waters. SisGAAz aims to increase efficiency of search and rescue operations and is to be co-developed with the police. Full implementation is scheduled by 2024

* Navigation Safety: This project foresees the expansion of the Brazilian Navy presence in the Amazon and Midwest region, as well as surveillance in border areas and large river basins.

**Brazilian Army:** The Brazilian Army’s strategic priority projects aim to equip brigades with equipment, weapons, transportation and supplies according to their growing needs. The projects will be implemented by 2035 with a total estimated value of R$ 60 billion (US 26 billion):

* Army Modernization Program: Includes modernization and revitalization of M60 combat vehicles, Leopard 1A1 and M113 armored vehicles. The program also includes the acquisition of river vessels, vehicles, artillery equipment, ammunition, and IA2 rifles developed locally by the Brazilian arms industry.

* Cyber Defense: This area includes the construction of a Cyber Defense Center, and entails acquisition of software and hardware solutions for that center.

* Guarani: This project calls for the introduction of a new family of wheeled armored vehicles, involving the purchase of 2,044 armored vehicles over the next 20 years. Includes several subprojects such as research and development, integrated logistic support, nationalization of ammunition, infrastructure and professional training.

* Integrated Border Monitoring System (_Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento de Fronteiras_; SISFRON, a system to protect Brazil’s borders. The project is divided into nine phases, the first of which was tendered in 2012 and was won by Consortium Tepro, a group made up of Savis Tecnologia e Sistemas S/A, OrbiSat Industrie and Aerolevantamento.

* Protection of Strategic Ground Structures (_Proteção de Estruturas Estratégicas Terrestres_; PROTEGER), a complex system designed around developing elite ground forces to protect strategic infrastructures and systems whose total or partial destruction would be a threat to national security. It will be integrated with other security systems, and will be under Ministry of Defense supervision and coordinated by the Ground Operations Command.

* Antiaircraft System: This project’s goal is to upgrade the existing air defense system in order to meet the requirements of the Brazilian Aerospace Defense System (_Sistema de Defesa Aeroespacial Brasileiro_; SISDABRA). The anti-aircraft artillery will be equipped with modern instruments and sensors, and assisted by an integrated logistics system that supports the equipment during its life cycle.

* Astros 2020: a program to protect Brazil’s borders, this includes development of a rocket/missile system with a range of up to 300 km, called Astros 2020. The Army intends to have two sets of missile launchers and rockets.

**Brazilian Air Force:** The Brazilian Air Force has nine strategic high priority projects to be implemented by 2030. A contract to build fighter jets recently awarded to Swedish company Gripen signals opportunity for such U.S. suppliers as GE, which supplied engines for Gripen planes. The total estimated value is R$132 billion (US$57 billion). The most important Air Force opportunities for U.S. companies include:

* Recovery of operating capacity: includes activities such as pilot training, rebuilding the stock of weaponry, technological upgrade of aircraft and systems on AMX, F5 fighters, and Maritime patrol P-95, P-3BR, and KC-130 and C95M.

* Airspace Control: This program will modernize the Aerospace Defense Operation Center (_Centro de Operações de Defesa Aeroespacial_) and acquire a new navigation control system called CNS/ATM.

* Operational Capability: This priority project includes acquisition of such aircraft and equipment as:

    + KC-X2 project: acquisition of two transport and replenishment aircraft to replace the KC-137. The Brazilian Air Force recently announced its selection of the Boeing 767-300. The aircraft will be outfitted by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).

    + VU-Y: acquisition of ten transport aircraft to replace the VU-35 and the EC-93. This project is in its study phase.

    + VANT: The Brazilian aerospace industry intends to develop a UAV in partnership with international companies. Transfer of technology will be required in this project.

    + CL-X: Involves acquisition of six CASA 295 aircraft for transport, search and rescue. The acquisition process has already begun.

* Scientific-Technological Proficiency: This project aims to gain technological independence with the development of several aircraft such as R-X for reconnaissance missions, E-X alarm and control, I-X flight inspection, F-XBR multiuse fighter, and UAVs.

* Strengthening Brazilian Aerospace and Defense Industry: aims to promote better integration between the Brazilian aerospace & defense industries and the Armed Forces. Development Space Activities: The National Program for Space Activities (_Programa Nacional de Atividades Espaciais_; PNAE) establishes the requirement for the development of the geostationary satellite program and a launch vehicle program.
