Total investment for logistics for roads and railways will be as follows:

**Logistics**: Brazil has one of the highest logistics costs in the world. Market analysts estimate that the distribution cost structure represents approximately 31.8% of logistics cost. This includes management, warehousing, inventory, legal requirements and transportation costs. Logistical costs represent an average of 20% of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP), twice that of the United States. The objective of the GOB’s Logistics Investment Program is to provide Brazil with a transportation system that reflects its continental scale. The project faced some challenges initially, but will use an investment model that favors partnerships between public and private sectors. Concessions will be used for highway projects, while public-private partnerships will be developed for railway projects.

**Roads**: Highways represent more than half of all public transportation infrastructure in Brazil, followed by railways with 25%, waterways with 17% and others, such as air transportation. As the chart above indicates, the GOB plans to spend US$32.8 billion in the next five years, with another US$11.8 billion in the following 20 years. This amount will be used to create and improve roads in the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and South). This process includes not only the construction of bridges and paths, but also their paving, duplication, maintenance and preservation. Brazil will also open concessions for some major highways in the northern and northeastern states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Goiás and Tocantins.

**Railways**: Brazil has less than half as many kilometers of railroads as do either China or India. Transportation by roads represents 61% of total freight, while that of railroad comprises 21%. Rail transportation has proven to be up to 30% cheaper and more efficient than paved roads. To make the country more competitive, the federal government plans to invest US$46 billion to build, repair and modernize Brazil’s railroads. US$28 billion will be invested within the next five years and US$17 billion in the 25 years following (see above chart). Such investments would result in 10,000 kilometers of expanded capacity. The objective is to improve the connection between the North and South regions by connecting preexisting railways and by building new ones.

**Ports**: In the past year, the Brazilian Government announced a concession program to attract some US$25 billion in investments for Brazil’s aging port infrastructure within the next four years. The main objective is to increase Brazil’s competitiveness, reduce barriers to market entry, modernize port management, increase trade, and reduce the high cost of doing business in Brazil. The government plans to re-auction 55 public terminals whose operators entered into contracts with the GOB before the 1993 Ports Law was approved. The concessions will not be awarded on the basis of the highest bidder, but rather on the most cargo moved at the lowest price. Port operators will be allowed to end the practice of differentiating between their own cargo and that of a third party. In effect, this change will allow privately-owned port operators to compete for container traffic for the first time. A national dredging plan of US$1.8 billion was also announced in the same ceremony; this may offer opportunities to U.S.-based dredge manufacturers and service providers. All of these investments will enable the reduction of tariffs and freight cost, contributing in turn to reduced cargo transportation by road.

**Waterways**: Brazil’s use of transportation by waterways is small when compared to other countries. For example, 25% of cargo is transported by river in the United States and 35% in Canada. In Brazil, only 14% of cargo is transported by this method. Brazil has enormous potential for river traffic with approximately 63,000 km of rivers and lakes, of which 45,000 km are navigable. The potential is still largely untapped, however, with navigation occurring in only 15,000 km, with a greatest concentration in the Amazon region. Currently, the largest share of investments comes from the public sector, representing 97% of the funds (or about US$3 billion per year). This situation is expected to change by the end of 2022, when mixed investments (private and public) may reach an average annual investment of US$ 4.6 billion.

**Public Transportation** The current metropolitan rail system transports about six million people daily throughout all major Brazilian cities. Research indicates that that figure should equal the number of people transported by the metro system in the metropolitan area of São Paulo alone. According to a study done by ANTP (National Association of Public Transportation), the social cost incurred by the city of São Paulo due to its current insufficient public transportation system is about R$40 billion a year (US$22.22 billion). Furthermore, the study showed that 63% of cities with more than 300,000 residents use illegal, unsafe and unreliable means of transportation; millions of people spend three to six hours a day traveling to and from work or school. These many problems in the current system signal opportunities for growth and investment, including for U.S. companies.
