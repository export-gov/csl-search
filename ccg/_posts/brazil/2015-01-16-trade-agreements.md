Brazil is a member of the Mercosul trading bloc, which has its own regional standards organization that issues and harmonizes standards. Technical committees write and recommend standards in selected areas. Each country must ratify the standard before they are adopted in that country. A number of standards have already been adopted as Mercosul standards. Adopted and proposed Mercosul standards are listed on Mercosul’s website: [http://www.amn.org.br](http://www.amn.org.br).

The Executive Secretariat of the Mercosul Standards Organization is located in São Paulo.
