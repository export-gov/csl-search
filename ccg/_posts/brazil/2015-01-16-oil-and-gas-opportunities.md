**Petrobras´ Importance**: The 2014 IHS Energy 50 publication ranked Petrobras as the ninth largest energy company in the world, in contrast with its seventh position in the 2012 and fifth position in the 2011 ranking:

Still, on March 6, 2014, Petrobras announced a net income in 2013 of R$23.6 billion, 11% higher than in 2012. As widely publicized, in 2012 Petrobras announced its worst result in eight years. Its net income fell 36% in comparison to 2011. Industry analysts blamed the Brazilian government’s control over Petrobras’ fuel prices as the main cause for Petrobras’ weak results in 2012. They also believe that sourcing equipment and services locally, more than the domestic industry may have been able to deliver, also caused project delays and inflated the costs of a number of Petrobras’ projects, thus impacting their financial results.

According to Petrobras, better results in 2013 resulted from various internal restructuring programs. To more efficiently optimize costs, Petrobras has also been reevaluating the economic feasibility of several projects (e.g. some previously planned refineries) before they resume or start construction. In view of these factors, a number of local equipment and service suppliers and engineering procurement and construction companies have experienced two weak sales years and uncertainties, because Petrobras is their main client.

Petrobras’ investments in 2013 reached R$104.4 billion (or about US$43 billion), most of which went to exploration and production (58%). Petrobras ended 2013 with 86,111 full-time employees (1,200 more employees than in 2012). A summary of the new Petrobras investment plan for the period 2014-2018 can be viewed at: [http://www.investidorpetrobras.com.br/en/presentations/presentation-to-analysts-2030-strategic-plan-and-2014-2018-business-plan-ceo-maria-das-gracas-silva-foster.htm](http://www.investidorpetrobras.com.br/en/presentations/presentation-to-analysts-2030-strategic-plan-and-2014-2018-business-plan-ceo-maria-das-gracas-silva-foster.htm)

**Market Entry**

Since state-owned Petrobras’ monopoly ended in 1998, more than 70 firms - half of which are international companies - started doing business in Brazil and competed for the 1,034 oil blocks awarded through twelve annual oil-concession licensing rounds plus the first pre-salt round. With Petrobras winning the majority of these concessions, interested suppliers need to register at [http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/supplier-channel/](http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/supplier-channel/) “Suppliers Channel Guide” in order to sell to Petrobras. The registration requires that a foreign firm have a local representative. It is our recommendation that U.S. firms not established in Brazil consider partnering with a local firm that is registered as a supplier to Petrobras rather than attempting to register directly. Also important is to connect with major EPCs with contracts to Petrobras, including Queiroz Galvão, Keppel Fels, Odebrecht, and others.

**Key Suppliers**

Multinationals such as FMC Energy, Cameron, Marine/Oceaneering, National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Weatherford, GE Wellstream, the Norwegian Aker Kvaerner, and the British Rolls Royce, among others, have plants and service facilities in Brazil and hold a significant market share in their respective sub sectors. A good listing of such international companies, as well as of Brazilian oil and gas manufacturers, can be found in the Oil and Gas Directory published by Brasil Energia magazine. The translated listing can be found at this website [http://www.guiapetroleo.com.br/](http://www.guiapetroleo.com.br/) . The Brazilian National Organization Industry (ONIP) also has an extensive databank of local suppliers at [http://www.onip.org.br/index.php](http://www.onip.org.br/index.php)
