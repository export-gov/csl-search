**Mandatory Testing and Mandatory Product Certification**

For regulated products, the relevant government agency generally requires that entities engaged in product testing and mandatory certification be accredited by INMETRO. Generally, testing must be performed in-country, unless the necessary capability does not exist in Brazil.

INMETRO is a signatory to the mutual recognition arrangement (MRA) of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), which can facilitate acceptance of test results from U.S. laboratories that are accredited by U.S. organizations and are also signatories.

For a complete list of MRAs to which INMETRO belongs, visit the following website: [http://www.inmetro.gov.br/english/international/mutual.asp](http://www.inmetro.gov.br/english/international/mutual.asp)

**Non-Mandatory Testing and Product Certification**

There is no legal mandate as of yet to retest non-regulated products that have been approved in their country of origin. For non-regulated products, some U.S. marks and product certification may be accepted. As with all voluntary standards, any certification that may be required in non-regulated sectors is a contractual matter to be decided between buyer and seller. Market forces and preferences sometimes require a specific certification.

To facilitate U.S. product acceptance in Brazil by recognizing existing certifications, agreements between U.S. and local certifiers/testing houses are encouraged. Also, there is no impediment for the establishment of U.S. certification organizations in Brazil. If your product has been certified in the U.S. or Europe, it probably will not need to be re-certified (see MRA above).

If your product is not certified, please refer to the mandatory product certification link: [http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/prodCompulsorios.asp](http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/prodCompulsorios.asp)
