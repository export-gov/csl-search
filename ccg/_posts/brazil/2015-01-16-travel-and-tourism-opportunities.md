Travel and tourism promotion in Brazil has seen success over the past two decades. Brazil’s large and diverse population means the country has a broad set of interests from which U.S. destinations can recruit travelers. For a U.S. destination, finding the hook for potential Brazilian travelers could lead to great returns.

Those working in tourism may want to capture some of the increasing niche markets of Brazilian travelers to the United States. Among Brazilians traveling with the specific aim of shopping, agents should consider tours specifically designed to cater to soon-to-be mothers and wedding shoppers. Officers also indicated that modest Brazilian shoppers find inexpensive accommodations in the outskirts of major cities and even take advantage of outlet shopping. Another growing market is the adventurous traveler who aspires to trek the famous Route 66 or participate in motorcycle road tours in the South.

Among first time travelers, Florida remains a popular destination, but some are making New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans or Las Vegas their first destination as well. Within this group, many have specific intentions to drive along the California coast, or drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Married Brazilian couples have also renewed their vows in various themed wedding chapels in Las Vegas.

Amongst young professional and business travelers, many opt to use their 30 days of vacation for an extended stay in the United States. Many take a light load of English language courses as incidental to tourism. Hours spent outside of class are dedicated to exploring a major city and getting a taste of American living before returning home. Agents should also take note of hobbyists and professional shoppers traveling to the U.S. specifically to purchase equipment, i.e., photographers, disc jockeys, artists, and farmers. Chicago, for example, is a major destination for architects and building lovers.

Several Brazilian travelers obtain U.S. visas with the specific purpose of transiting to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Japan and Caribbean cruises with the intention of adding a quick stay in the U.S. for shopping. Agents may want to capture this market to facilitate the needs of these travelers, who simply want quick and easy access to shopping and dining.

Each year, the U.S. Commercial Service in Brazil organizes the **VISIT USA** shows. This is the most effective and affordable vehicle for the U.S. travel trade industry to increase its market exposure in Brazil. **VISIT USA 2014 Brazil** took place in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Campinas (interior of the state of São Paulo) in May 2014, and was visited by over 1,600 select travel agents, tour operators and media visitors in all three cities.
