Brazil is South America’s largest clean energy market, generating nearly 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Brazil’s commitment to renewable energy is strong, driven by both its immense renewable energy resource potential and rising energy demand.

New clean energy investments in Brazil totaled $5.34 billion in 2012, more than any other Latin American country. While no specific legislative targets exist, Brazil’s “Ten-Year Energy Plan,” published in 2011, envisions 18 GW of new, renewable energy capacity being brought online by 2020. Given Brazil’s existing manufacturing capacity, meeting this target will require the use of both imported and domestically produced technologies. However, many of the Brazilian Government’s incentives are geared towards supporting locally-sourced products, thus making export projections difficult.

According to the Brazilian National Energy Balance published by EPE (Energy Research Company), renewable energy in Brazil is registering an average annual expansion of 12%, with special emphasis on wind energy, biomass from sugarcane and small hydropower plants.

With growth occurring in almost every energy subsector, large-volume hydropower still accounts for the vast majority of Brazil’s energy capacity. Large hydropower dams account for 84 GW of Brazil’s total energy capacity. Other renewable energy technologies account for 15.8 GW of capacity, including 9.84 GW for biomass and waste-to-energy, 3.69 GW for small hydropower, and 2.46 GW of wind power.

Since the successful launch in 2002 of the “Program of Incentives for Alternative Energy Sources (PROINFA),” which resulted in 3.1 GW of new renewable energy generation, the Government of Brazil (GOB) has used a broad range of policies to encourage the deployment of renewable energy. These include guaranteed 20-year power purchase agreements, biofuel blending mandates, low-interest financing, and tax-based incentives.

In 2009, PROINFA was replaced by a reverse auction system, through which developers seeking to build renewable energy projects compete against proposed conventional energy projects in regular tenders. The reverse auctions have reduced the price paid by Brazilian consumers for renewable energy, as developers are incentivized to offer the lowest possible cost. The focus on price competition, however, has limited opportunities for solar or other higher priced technologies. Brazil has therefore held biomass- and wind-specific auctions to encourage the deployment of these technologies.
