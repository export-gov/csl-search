U.S. Department of State travel advisory on Brazil:

[http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/brazil.html](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/brazil.html).

In general, crime rates throughout Brazil are high, especially in large cities. The incidence of crime against tourists is greater in areas surrounding beaches, hotels, bars, nightclubs, and other similar establishments that cater to visitors and is especially prevalent during _Carnaval_ (Brazilian _Mardi Gras_). Occasionally, crime against tourists has been violent and has led to some deaths. While the risk is greater at dusk and during evening hours, street crime can occur any time and areas considered “safer” are not immune. Incidents of theft on city buses are frequent, and such transportation should be avoided. Several Brazilian cities have established specialized tourist police units to patrol areas frequented by tourists.

“Express kidnappings,” where victims are abducted and forced to withdraw money from ATMs, occur often enough to warrant caution. At airports, hotel lobbies, bus stations, and other public places there is much pick-pocketing, and the theft of carry-on luggage, briefcases, and laptop computers is common (including some reports of thefts on domestic flights). Travelers should "dress down" when outside and avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewelry or expensive watches. "Good Samaritan" scams are common. If a tourist looks lost or seems to be having trouble communicating, they may be victimized by a seemingly innocent and helpful bystander. Care should be taken at and around banks and internationally connected automatic teller machines that take U.S. credit or debit cards. Poor neighborhoods known as "_favelas_" are found throughout Brazil. These areas are sites of criminal activity and are often not patrolled by police. U.S. citizens are advised to avoid these unsafe places.

While the ability of Brazilian police to help recover stolen property is limited, it is nevertheless strongly advised to obtain a "_boletim de ocorrência_" (police report) at a "_delegacia_" (police station) whenever any possessions are lost or stolen. This will facilitate insurance claims and the traveler's exit from Brazil.
