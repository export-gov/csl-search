According to Acton International, a U.S.-based international direct marketing services provider, the Brazilian consumer receives an estimated 9.3 pieces of direct mail every month. Its research has shown that 74% of Brazilian consumers like receiving direct mail. With increased expendable income in the growing middle class, direct marketing is an effective option to include in a companyâ€™s marketing communications strategy for Brazil.

Brazil continues to lead Latin America in direct marketing activities due to its large consumer base and growing economy. The Brazilian Association of Direct Marketing (ABEMD) is a self-regulated, non-profit entity representing the direct marketing sector.
