**Direct Loan to Buyer by Brazilian Development Bank (in foreign currency)**

Local companies can arrange at-market or even below-market direct loans with the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). In many cases, the funds can be used to purchase goods from U.S. exporters. Some companies observe that the loan approval process can be bureaucratic and consequently slow.

**Import Finance by a Latin American Bank (in foreign currency)**

Generally, a bank located in a Latin American country pays a U.S. exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a buyer in the region. The bank is essentially providing the buyer a loan, which buyer will then repay per their financing agreement. In Latin American banks, this type of financing usually has a six-month grace period, after which the buyer must begin repaying the lending bank. Although extremely expensive for Latin American buyers, this option is frequently the only alternative available to them, particularly when they are purchasing major capital equipment. Ex-Im also offers a variety of trade and project finance options.
