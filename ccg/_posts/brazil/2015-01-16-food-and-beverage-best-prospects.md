**Products present in the market which have good sales potential**

Importers are generally looking for well-known brands and high-end products. Brazilian importers/distributors usually prefer products with nine months shelf life or more. In addition to the product itself, packaging, status and level of innovation are important attributes. Products that combine these characteristics are more likely to successfully enter the market. Currently, the food categories that are most exported to Brazil from the United States are: meat products, eggs and products, dairy products, fresh fruit, processed fruit, processed vegetables, fruit and vegetable juices, tree nuts, chocolate and cocoa products, snack foods, breakfast cereals, condiments and sauces, prepared food, wine, beer, distilled spirits, non-alcoholic beverages (ex. juices) and fish products.
