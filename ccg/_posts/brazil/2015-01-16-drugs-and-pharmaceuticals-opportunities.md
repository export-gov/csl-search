Brazil’s pharmaceutical market represents an excellent opportunity for US firms wishing to enter the market. The size of the pharmaceutical market is significant and is expected to grow as the government lowers taxes on these products. Tax decreases will not only increase client sales for current patients, but will also attract new consumers who forego cost prohibitive medications and other treatments due to financial constraints.

Opportunities for US firms to export raw materials to Brazil are abundant. Approximately 85% of the raw materials used in the production of generic drugs in Brazil are imported. In addition, major demand for equipment and services associated with the construction of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants represents another opportunity for US exporters.

Due to the recent expiration of several drug patents, the market for generic drugs will present new opportunities for laboratories. Multinational companies are investing in the acquisition of local laboratories in order to establish a stronger presence in this segment and produce locally. Also, the GOB is stimulating the production of medicines locally to replace imports of drugs for treatment of Alzheimer’s, HIV, cerebral aneurysm, leishmaniasis and malaria.
