The market for home health care products has been increasing in recent years. Brazilian health insurance companies are responsible for paying 99% of the costs related to home care treatment. As such, the U.S. Commercial Service sees the market for home health care products growing dramatically within the coming years.

The Government of Brazil is offering opportunities to companies that are interested in partnerships to transfer technology for domestic production through its public private partnership program, in an effort to reduce the deficit trade balance in the health care sector. U.S. exporters may consider the opportunities offered by Mercosur* for companies that manufacture or assemble medical devices in Brazil. It is possible to use it as a "spring board" for export into other South American countries.

Since compulsory product registration before sale is required for all of Mercosur countries, US exporters should consult a local lawyer/consultant before signing a contract with any agent/distributor.

_(*) Mercosur (Mercado del Sur) is composed of 5 sovereign member states: Argentina; Brazil; Paraguay; Uruguay; and Venezuela. Bolivia became an acceding member on 7 December 2012._
