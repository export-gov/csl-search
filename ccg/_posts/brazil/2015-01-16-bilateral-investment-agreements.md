Brazil does not have a Bilateral Investment Treaty with the United States. In the 1990â€™s Brazil signed BITs with Belgium and Luxembourg, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Venezuela, but none of these have been approved by the Brazilian Congress. In 2002, an inter-ministerial working group decided to withdraw the agreements from Congress for approval, so they have not and will not be voted on any time soon. Brazil also has not approved the Mercosul investment protocol.

Brazil does not have a double taxation treaty with the United States, but it does have such treaties with 31 other countries, including, among others, Japan, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada and Argentina. Brazil signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with the United States in March 2007, and that agreement entered into force on May 15, 2013, signed by President Dilma Rousseff in Decree 8003/2013.
