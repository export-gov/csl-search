Approximately 80% of Brazilian students who study abroad come from Brazil’s southern and central eastern states. São Paulo has the largest applicant pool, and also attracts the most talented students to its own university campuses. The capital city of Brasília, located in Distrito Federal (Federal District) has the country’s highest GDP per capita, at approximately US$25,000, over twice that of São Paulo, its closest competitor state. The state of Rio de Janeiro, home of the largest company in Latin America, Petrobras, is the country’s energy hub, attracting many engineering and science majors.

The main challenge for many Brazilian students applying for study abroad programs is their lack of English language skills. Institutions that can address this issue by providing conditional acceptance tied to English language training may have a competitive advantage in attracting Brazilian students.

For this reason, in 2012 the Ministry of Education launched “English without Borders”, an initiative to support university students that improves English language teaching in schools through a variety of learning methodologies. Approximately 2 million user accounts will be provided to an online English teaching course, over 250,000 TOEFL exams will be offered to assess students’ language ability, and classroom courses will be provided by public universities to those students who fit the profile for the Scientific Mobility Program.

The Brazil Scientific Mobility Undergraduate Program focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Engineering and computer science are by far the most popular majors; however, a number of students are enrolled in social science, business, and the arts (focused on products and processes for technological development and innovation). Below are the top 10 fields of study among Scientific Mobility students:
