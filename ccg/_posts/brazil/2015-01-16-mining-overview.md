Total Market Size = (Total Local Production + Total Imports) – (Total Exports)

Brazil is the world’s fifth largest mineral producer and, as a result, one of the world’s largest markets for mining equipment. The highest output for most minerals in Brazil was achieved in 2008. In 2009, a big recession followed in the international mining market, and while output of most minerals has since increased, the level is still below the record year of 2008. Prices for mineral commodities depend basically on the international market and have decreased significantly in the last few years, negatively impacting the financial situation of most Brazilian mining companies.

IBRAM released an estimate in March 2014, stating that local mining companies will invest US$53.6 billion in new projects between 2014 and 2018. This is considered a very low volume of investments, given the potential of the country, especially when compared to US$75 billion previously estimated for the period 2012 to 2016. Most of the cutbacks in the total volume of investment were in iron ore, which is Brazil’s main mineral and is responsible for nearly 60% of the total investments in mining in Brazil. Brazil’s iron ore operations have an output of nearly 500 million metric tons/year (Mt/y), representing 16% of the world’s total.

According to IBRAM, there are several reasons for the slowdown in this sector, notably falling prices for commodities, excessive bureaucracy for the necessary environmental permits, difficulty in raising local capital and a federal mining regulatory framework which is currently undergoing revision by Congress. The price per ton for iron ore has fallen from a peak of US$190 in 2011 to between US$110 - 115. The price for gold has fallen to 45% below its peak price in 2011. As of today, at least 14 gold projects or operations have been halted in Brazil, most by smaller companies. The price of aluminum likewise fell 60% during the last four years, and three big projects have been halted for this reason.

China has played a very important role for Brazilian mining companies. The nation has become the largest importer of Brazil’s minerals, especially iron ore. Most of the new projects developed or planned in Brazil are tied to China’s demand for Brazilian mineral resources.

The full potential for output of Brazilian minerals has not been fully surveyed, and significant discoveries of mineral deposits are expected in the future. Investments in geological exploration in Brazil in 2013 are estimated to have been US$ 300 million, very low when compared to US$1.6 billion in Australia.

The most important minerals in Brazil, with their respective production stated in millions of metric tons per year (Mt/y), or metric tons per year (t/y) in 2013, and the Brazilian share of the world production are:

Brazil is the world’s largest producer of niobium, the second largest producer of iron ore and manganese, and the third largest producer of bauxite.

The total value of mineral commodities produced in Brazil in 2013 is estimated to be US$44 billion, concentrated in the central state of Minas Gerais (45% of the total), and in the northern state of Pará (in the Carajás mining area, in the Amazon region), with 30% of the total. Brazil’s coal production is small and has been stagnant for the last 20 years. The output in 2012 was only 6 Mt/y of steam coal (compared to 5 Mt/y in 1991), only 0.2% of the world’s total, but there are plans to increase its output to 12 Mt by 2017, in order to supply several new local coal power plants. Total Brazilian deposits of coal are estimated to be 32 billion metric tons, or only 0.3% of the world’s total. There are nine coal power plants currently in operation in Brazil, with a combined capacity of 3.205 MW, equivalent to only 2% of the total electricity consumption of the country. There are projects by local companies underway to start up several new coal power plants in Brazil in the next five years, for a combined capacity of 3,000 MW (megawatts).

Brazil is one of the largest importers of metallurgical coal, used by local steel manufacturers. It has imported approximately 16 million metric tons/year (US$2 billion) of metallurgical coal. Metallurgical coal totaled 40% of the total value of Brazilian mineral imports in 2012. The main supplying countries have been Australia, U.S.A., Canada, and South Africa. Vale, the largest Brazilian mining company, has made large investments in coal mining in Australia and in Mozambique in the last five years. It had an output of 8.8 Mt/y of coal in these countries during 2013. The total deposits are 2.5 billion metric tons, and the total output is planned to reach 40 Mt/year.

The U.S. has always been one of the largest exporting countries to the Brazilian mining equipment market, with a share of 20% to 30% of Brazilian imports. Official statistics show that the U.S. has exported hundreds of types of components for mining machinery in Brazil. Other very strong exporters competing with U.S. interests are Germany, Sweden, Canada, China, France, Italy, Finland, and Japan.

Gold: The total Brazilian output of gold in 2012 was 70 metric tons of gold metal. It is expected to expand to 90 t/y of gold metal in 2016, according to the Brazilian Mining Institute. The Canadian Kinross Group became Brazil’s largest gold producer in 2008, when it started up a new project of US$ 550 million and increased its output of gold metal from 5.4 to 17.2 metric tons / year. Other large producers of gold in Brazil are AngloGold Ashanti, Yamana Gold and Jaguar Mining. Individual prospectors have a share of nearly 13% of the total output.
