Strikes and demonstrations occur occasionally in urban areas and may cause temporary disruption to public transportation. Occasional port strikes also impact commerce. Large, widespread protests occurred in June 2013 during the Confederations Cup, an international soccer tournament held in six cities. The protests started in response to a hike in bus fares and later grew to include complaints regarding the governmentâ€™s perceived inability to tackle corruption and improve public services, such as education and healthcare. Despite dire warnings in advance of the 2014 World Cup, Brazil has been widely celebrated for hosting a safe and well-organized event.
