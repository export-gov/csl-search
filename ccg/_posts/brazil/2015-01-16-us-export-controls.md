At this time, the U.S. Government maintains no export controls specific to Brazil. Normal controls are maintained on military equipment, high-tech information systems, and equipment of a highly sensitive nature. Items on the Munitions Control List are also a controlled export to nearly all countries worldwide, including Brazil, requiring special licenses from the State Department or Commerce Department depending upon the item. You can see the current list of export controls at the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website:
