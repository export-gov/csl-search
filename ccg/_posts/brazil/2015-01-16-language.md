Portuguese is Brazilâ€™s official language. English proficiency varies among Brazilian business persons. It is usually a good idea to have an interpreter accompany you to meetings and on business calls. Correspondence and product literature should be in Portuguese, and English is preferred as a substitute over Spanish. Specifications and other technical data should be in the metric system.
