Following the acquisition of BankBoston by Brazil- based Itaú Unibanco in May 2006, U.S. presence in the Brazilian banking system was reduced to commercial activities by Citibank, investment banking by JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and BNY Mellon; consumer credit for automobiles and agricultural machinery and goods; and IT purchases by such U.S. corporations as General Motors (Banco GMAC), IBM (Banco IBM), Caterpillar (Banco Caterpillar), John Deere (Banco John Deere), Cargill (Banco Cargill), Ford (Banco Ford) and remittances (Western Union).

Brazil’s strong foreign trade sector and its increasing trade activities have led the country’s larger banks to increase their numbers of correspondent banks around the globe, in both new and expanding markets as well as with such traditional trading partners as the U.S.

Ex-Im Bank provides export insurance and working capital for U.S. exporters as well as guaranteed loans for Brazilian importers. Ask your bank’s international department about their affiliations with banks in Brazil, and inquire whether they work with Ex -Im Bank. Ex-Im also provides contact information for insurance brokers and guaranteed lenders.
