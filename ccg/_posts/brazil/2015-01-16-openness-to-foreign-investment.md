FDI is prevalent across Brazil’s economy, although certain sectors are subject to foreign ownership limitations. A 1995 constitutional amendment terminated the distinction between foreign and local capital in general, but there are laws that restrict foreign ownership within some sectors, notably aviation, insurance, and media.

Aviation: The Government of Brazil currently restricts foreign investment in domestic airline companies to a maximum of 20 percent. A bill in the Chamber of Deputies (PL6716) that would increase the ceiling to 49 percent has been pending since 2009.

On March 19, 2011, representatives from the U.S. and Brazilian governments signed an Air Transport Agreement that will lead to an Open Skies relationship between the United States and Brazil, eliminating numerical limits on passenger and cargo flights between the two countries. If it is approved by Brazil’s Congress, the agreement will take effect in October 2015. Both parties also signed a Memorandum of Consultation (MOC) that incrementally increases flight limits in the meantime. For example, in October 2013, the maximum number of weekly passenger flights was increased by 42 flight frequencies for Brazilian airlines and 42 for U.S. airlines, including 14 frequencies that can be used in the São Paulo metropolitan area. At the same time, the maximum number of cargo flights allowed rose by 14 per week for each country’s airlines. Additional increases will take effect in October 2014.

Insurance: U.S. companies wanting to enter Brazil’s insurance and reinsurance market must establish a subsidiary, enter into a joint venture, or acquire or partner with a local company. Market entry for banks may occur on a case-by-case basis. The Brazilian reinsurance market was opened to competition in 2007. In December 2010 and March 2011, however, the Brazilian National Council on Private Insurance (CNSP) effectively rolled back market liberalization through the issuance of Resolutions 225 and 232, which disproportionately affect foreign insurers operating in the Brazilian market. Resolution 225 requires that 40 percent of all reinsurance risk be placed with Brazilian companies. Resolution 232 allows insurance companies to place only 20 percent of risk with affiliated reinsurance companies. In December 2011, the CNSP issued Resolution 241, which walked back some of the restrictions of Resolution 225 by allowing the 40 percent requirement to be waived if local reinsurance capacity does not exist.

Media: In September 2011, President Rousseff signed into force a law covering the subscription television market, including satellite and cable TV that will remove the previous 49 percent limit on foreign ownership of cable TV companies. Under the law, telecom companies will be allowed to offer television packages with their service. Content quotas will require every channel to air at least three and a half hours per week of Brazilian programming during primetime. Additionally, one- third of all channels included in any TV package will have to be Brazilian. In order to gauge public opinion regarding the telecom sector before proposing revisions to existing regulations, the Brazilian Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) organized public consultations in February 2013. It was anticipated that revisions to regulations would be enacted in 2013, but no changes were made. While the results of these consultations are being considered, the previously existing law still prevails.

Foreign investment restrictions remain in a limited number of other sectors, including highway freight (20 percent) and mining of radioactive ore. Foreign ownership of land within 150 km of national borders remains prohibited unless approved by Brazil’s National Security Council. In October 2009, the Chamber of Deputies approved legislation that would further restrict foreign ownership of land along Brazil’s borders and within the Amazon. The proposed legislation (PL 4440/2001) still requires passage by the Brazilian Senate, followed by presidential approval before it can become law. The Senate has not yet brought the bill up for a vote.

On August 23, 2013, the National Land Reform and Settlement Institute (INCRA) published a set of new rules covering the purchase of Brazilian land by foreigners. These rules follow an August 2010 Attorney General’s opinion that similarly limited foreign agricultural land ownership. Under the new rules, the area bought or leased by foreigners cannot account for more than 25 percent of the overall area in any municipal district. Additionally, no more than 10 percent of the land in any given municipal district may be owned or leased by foreign nationals from the same country. The rules also make it necessary to obtain congressional approval before large plots of land can be purchased by foreigners, foreign companies, or Brazilian companies with the majority of shareholders from foreign countries. There are several proposed bills -- PL 2289/2007, PL 2376/2007, PL 3483/2008, PL 4240/2008 and PL 4059/2012 -- pending in the Brazilian Congress which would clarify the process for foreigners who want to purchase land.

In the state of São Paulo, due to a judicial impasse, foreigners have been able to buy unrestricted amounts of land since the end of 2013. Companies controlled by foreign entities have been taking advantage of the opportunity and have been seeking investment properties.

Infrastructure Concessions: Brazil has begun an ambitious USD 240 billion Logistics Investment Program (PIL) to draw in private capital and managerial expertise to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, including projects in roads, ports, airports, energy, and urban mobility. All of the infrastructure concessions are open to foreign companies. In fact, in the airport concessions, foreign companies have not only been encouraged to bid, but the auction criteria have been defined in a way that has the effect of requiring the participation of foreign airport operators. The bidding process is non-discriminatory, transparent, and performed without political interference.

Domestic Investment Goals: In addition to the PIL mentioned above, between January 2011 and December 2013, the government’s Program to Accelerate Growth (PAC) disbursed R$773 billion to fund transportation, energy, housing, and sanitation projects, representing 76.1 percent of total spending projected by the end of 2014. Under the program, an estimated R$959 billion was allocated for the period of 2011 through 2014.

In August 2011, Brazil announced a new industrial policy, Plano Brasil Maior (the “Bigger Brazil” plan), to support domestic producers, encourage investment, and spur innovation. The plan, covering the period of 2011-2014, sets targets for investment spending to reach 22.4 percent of GDP by 2014, up from a 2010 baseline of 18.4 percent. Private investment in R&D is to reach 0.90 percent of GDP by 2014, up from the 2010 figure of 0.59 percent. Brasil Maior also sets targets for making the economy more energy-efficient, reducing the amount of petroleum used per unit of GDP by 9 percent, and nearly tripling broadband internet penetration from 13.8 million households in 2010 to 40 million households in 2014. No mid-term progress reports have been released.

The latest OECD Economic Survey for Brazil was released in 2013. The Survey applauds Brazil’s efforts to promote inclusive growth and to sustainably manage natural resources, but recommends continued fiscal consolidation, more aggressive monetary policy to bring inflation closer towards the center of the target band, and improvements to productivity and competitiveness.
