**Brazil’s Travel & Tourism Distribution System**

While wholesalers are key travel distributors, Brazil’s has 10,000 travel agencies with 60% of agencies issuing international tickets. Many travel agencies also serve as tour operators. As a result, the competition is stiff, prompting many agencies to upgrade technologies to improve efficiency.

Associations are important in Brazil’s travel industry. The Brazilian Tour Operators Association (Braztoa), formed by 70 operators, is the main association of tour operators. The Brazilian Travel Agencies Association (ABAV) has approximately 3,500 members responsible for just over 80% of travel sales. The majority of Brazil’s visitors to the U.S. go through a travel agency, while others go directly to airlines to purchase tickets through the Internet. Others use state/city travel offices.
