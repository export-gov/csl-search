Success in Brazilâ€™s business culture relies heavily upon the development of strong personal relationships, the keystone of productive business partnerships. In most cases, U.S. firms need a local presence and thus should invest time in developing relationships through frequent visits to Brazil. The U.S. Commercial Service encourages U.S. companies visiting Brazil to meet one-on-one with potential partners, and offers a slate of services such as our Gold Key Service (GKS), through which companies can meet with pre-screened potential clients or partners in personal meetings. We also lead delegations of Brazilian buyers to connect with U.S. businesses at more than 30 International Buyer Program trade shows in the U.S.

It is essential to work through a qualified representative or distributor when developing new business in the Brazilian market. Some firms may need to establish an office or joint venture in Brazil. It is difficult for U.S. companies to get involved in public sector procurement at the federal or state levels without a Brazilian partner, or a physical presence in Brazil.
