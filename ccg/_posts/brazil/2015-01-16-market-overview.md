The Federative Republic of Brazil is Latin America's largest economy. With 3,290,000 square miles, bordering 10 other countries and with 4,650 miles of coastline, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America and fifth largest in the world. Its population of 202 million makes Brazil the world’s sixth-most populous nation. With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013 of US$2.3 trillion, Brazil is the world’s seventh-largest economy, spurred by a 2.5% annual growth during 2013. Growth slowed during last year due to reduced demand for Brazilian exports in Europe and Asia and modest consumer demand from Brazil’s large middle class. By 2020, Brazil is projected to be the fifth-largest consumer market in the world, ahead of France and the United Kingdom.

During the past decade, the country has maintained macroeconomic policies that control inflation and promote economic growth. Inflation was 6.3% in April 2014. Urban unemployment was at 4.9% in April 2014, dropping from 6% in mid-2013; wages continue to increase. Interest rates are high by international standards: Brazil’s Central Bank benchmark rate was at a historic low of 7.25% in October 2012, but as of May 2014 had climbed to 11%, which is still low by Brazilian standards.

In 2013, the U.S. was Brazil’s second largest source of imports, accounting for 15% of total imported goods; behind China and followed by Argentina, Germany, and Nigeria. In 2013, Brazil imported over US$239 billion of total goods, including US$44 billion from the U.S. – a modest 0.7% increase over 2012. Brazil was the United StatesBrazil seventh-largest export market for goods in 2013. Brazil is also a large market for U.S. services, accounting for an additional $24 billion in exports in 2012 (latest available data). The trade balance with Brazil for U.S. services has continually increased since 2003, reaching a surplus for the U.S. of $17 billion as of 2012.
