Although U.S. architectural firms face a competitive environment, many U.S. firms have been winning contracts. For example, U.S. firms have recently won design contracts in Rio de Janeiro related to the upcoming 2016 Olympic Village, the new golf course to be used for the Olympics, and the new Museum of Image and Sounds, to be relocated to the Copacabana area in Rio. U.S. engineering equipment providers have also been successful in the Brazilian market, several with a local presence, such as Caterpillar, John Deere, and Terex, among others.

However, many large procurement projects that involve construction and architectural design services are won by Brazilian engineering and construction companies such as Odebrecht, OAS and Camargo Correa, among others. Thus, the U.S. Commercial Service recommends that U.S. architectural and engineering firms with no physical presence in Brazil partner with Brazilian architecture, engineering and constructions firms before bidding directly on projects.

Brazil recognizes that in order to continue growing effectively, the nation needs to bring in expertise and technology that is currently not available or is in short supply in Brazil. This is where U.S. companies can play a role.
