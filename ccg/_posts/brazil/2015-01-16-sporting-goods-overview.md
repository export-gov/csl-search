Brazilâ€™s sporting goods and recreational equipment market today is mostly supplied by small to medium sized domestic manufacturers. Imports represent approximately 30% of the market. Imports from the United States, as well as from Europe and Japan, will grow as demand for quality and certified products accelerate. Although at a much smaller scale, imports from Asia may grow rapidly, due to aggressive pricing.
