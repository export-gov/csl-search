Brazil has a very limited market for turnkey machinery in general, as a large number of leading multinational manufacturers have their own factories in Brazil. In fact, many of them even export their products. These companies, though, provide excellent opportunities for U.S. manufacturers of hundreds of parts and components for most types of mining equipment, such as earth-moving machines, belt conveyors, crushers and grinding equipment, laboratory instruments, drill bits and geological survey systems.

Products (or components) that are not locally produced, either by foreign or local firms have the highest success rate for entry into the market. Otherwise, the imported product will need to offer much higher technology or cost/benefit compared to the locally-made ones, as local companies tend to prefer buying locally even if there is a difference in quality. Import taxes and fees in Brazil are very high in the mining sector, and import procedures complicated and bureaucratic, forcing buyers to favor local over imported products. Most of Brazilâ€™s mines are open pit, so the market for underground mining equipment is very small, though more underground mines are expected to open in the future.
