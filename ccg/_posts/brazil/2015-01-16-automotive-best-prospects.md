The Inovar Auto program initiated a new investment cycle in the automotive sector in Brazil, through which the industry will produce world class, high value-added products. Some of the expected results of the program are that the OEMs will increase their investments in high productivity equipment and processes, which allow lower energy consumption; and in precision measurement and testing equipment, quality standard certifications, training, and increased use of light materials, so as to reach the emission reduction target of 18.84% of CO2/Km. It is also expected that OEMs will increase the amount of automobile project designs in Brazil.

The industry is also evaluating new propulsion technologies, which include the use of flex fuel engines in hybrid vehicles and application of ethanol in fuel cells. In order to develop technologies for producing electric and hybrid vehicles in Brazil in 2017, ANFAVEA requested temporary tax exemption on a limited number of imported electric and hybrid automobiles, as well as on repair parts, until 2016. Some developments are underway to introduce electric vehicles in Brazil.
