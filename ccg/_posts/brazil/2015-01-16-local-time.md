Most of Brazil observes daylight savings time from October to February – with the exception of the Northeast region, which does not observe daylight savings. Note, however, that the U.S. and Brazil do not change daylight savings at the same time. When daylight savings is in effect in the United States, i.e. March to November, Brazilian time is one hour ahead of Eastern Daylight Time. When daylight savings is in effect in Brazil, i.e., October to February, Brazilian time is three hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.

While office hours in Brazil are generally 8 am to 6 pm, decision-makers begin work later in the morning and stay later in the evening. The best times for calls on a Brazilian executive are between 10 am and noon, and 3 pm and 5 pm, although this is less the case for São Paulo where appointments are common throughout most of the day. Lunch often lasts two hours.

January, February, and July are difficult months in which to schedule business meetings with high-level decision-makers. Schoolchildren are on vacation; hence many families choose this time to take their long vacations. Brazilians go back to work after the Carnaval holiday (which usually falls in late February or early March).
