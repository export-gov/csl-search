Aerospace is one of Brazil’s most important industries and offers excellent opportunities for U.S. aircraft manufacturers and parts suppliers. Over the last ten years, Brazil has been one of the top 10 destinations for U.S. exports of manufactured aerospace products. In 2013 alone, U.S. exports of aerospace products to Brazil achieved US$6.8 billion.

The industry is led by Embraer, the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer. In 2013, Embraer delivered 215 aircraft, which consisted of 90 commercial jets, 119 business jets, and 6 military aircraft. The other key player is Helibras, the Brazilian subsidiary of Airbus Helicopters. This company has been producing helicopters in Brazil since 1978 and is positioned as a world class helicopter manufacturer. Every year, the company delivers around 36 helicopters produced in Itajuba, State of Minas Gerais; serving the civilian, military, and law enforcement markets.

Companies interested in supplying to these OEMs in Brazil must undergo a strict qualification process of the company, product, and technology; however, once they have been qualified they will find excellent opportunities. Embraer annually imports over US$2 billion of aircraft components to support its Brazilian operations, and is always open to develop new suppliers with recognized technology and qualification in the aeronautic industry. U.S. companies interested in supplying to Embraer must be registered under the AS9100 series by an accredited Certification/Registration Body as indicated by IAQG ([www.iaqg.sae.org/iaqg](www.iaqg.sae.org/iaqg) ). Distributors must be registered under AS9120. And, for tooling suppliers, Embraer requires registration to ISO 9001.

Brazil also offers excellent opportunities for general aviation aircraft and parts suppliers. According to the Brazilian Association of General Aviation (ABAG), Brazil has the world’s second largest executive aircraft fleet and its third largest helicopter fleet. The general aviation fleet grew 6.7% in 2012, reaching a total of 13,965 aircraft. The demand should continue growing over the next few years. The registered number of helicopters in 2012 was 1,893, mostly concentrated in the State of Sao Paulo (690), Minas Gerais (219), and Rio de Janeiro (422). More than one third of the fleet is less than five years old.

Aeronautical maintenance and repair is another sector that should not be overlooked. This sector is currently estimated at US$600 million, and has been enjoying annual expansion of 5-6% over the last few years.

All aeronautical products must obtain certification issued by ANAC, the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency.
