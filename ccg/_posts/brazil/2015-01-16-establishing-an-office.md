Investment options in Brazil include either setting up a company in Brazil or acquiring an existing entity. Setting up new companies has become increasingly easier, as the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC) has signaled a desire to simplify the process. According to MDIC, Brazilian authorities have significantly reduced the amount of time required to grant various licenses and registrations over the past few years.

The Central Bank monitors acquisitions of existing companies. Corporations (_“sociedades anônimas”_) and limited liability companies (_“limitadas”_) are relatively easy to form. Brazilian law requires that foreign capital be registered with the Central Bank. Failure to comply may cause serious foreign exchange losses, as well as problems with capital repatriation or profit remittance. More information for potential investors can be found in our Investment Climate section (see #Chapter 6), or through Brazil’s Ministry of External Relations’ web resources.
