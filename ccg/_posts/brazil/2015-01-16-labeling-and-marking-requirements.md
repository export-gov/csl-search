The Brazilian Customer Protection Code requires that product labeling provide the consumer with precise and easily readable information about the product’s quality, quantity, composition, price, guarantee, shelf life, origin, and risks to the consumer’s health and safety. Imported products should bear a Portuguese translation of this information. Products should be labeled in metric units or show a metric equivalent.

More information can be found regarding required and recommended labeling and marking in USCS Brazil’s report on standards at: [http://www.ita.doc.gov/td/standards/Markets/Brazil.htm](http://www.ita.doc.gov/td/standards/Markets/Brazil.htm)
