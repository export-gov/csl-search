Although some companies import directly from foreign manufacturers without local representation, in most cases the presence of a local agent or distributor is essential. As in other countries, the selection of an agent requires careful consideration. Because of regional economic disparities, varying states of infrastructure, complex inter-state trade and taxation rules, and a host of other issues, it is often difficult to find one distributor that has complete national coverage.

The U.S. Commercial Service strongly recommends that exporters and representatives consult with a Brazilian legal representative before writing or signing an agreement. This will help exporters abide by Brazilian laws, particularly to limit liabilities, protect trademarks, better ensure payments, and define warranty terms. Clauses related to exclusivity, promotional obligations, service and support duties, localization and performance targets, among others, may be included within the agreement.
