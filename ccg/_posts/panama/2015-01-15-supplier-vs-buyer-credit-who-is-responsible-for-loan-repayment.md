**The first variation depends on who, contractually, is assuming the responsibility for repaying the loan.** Is it the US Exporter or is it the Foreign Buyer? If the Exporter is responsible for repaying the loan it is called **Supplier Credit**. If the Buyer is responsible for repaying the loan, it is called **Buyer Credit**.

Accordingly, Supplier Credit is far riskier for the US Exporter than Buyer Credit due to the fact that under the terms of Supplier Credit, even if the foreign buyer fails to pay the US Exporter the US Exporter is still contractually obliged to repay the lending bank the full loan amount.

It is important to recognize that when US exporters sell to foreign buyers, including Latin America, it is rare that banks will approve Credit (either Supplier or Buyer) without a guarantee from either Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or another Export Credit Insurer). Accordingly, the following two types of Export Finance are uncommon but do exist in cases in which the US Exporter is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Supplier Credit) or in which the Foreign Buyer is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Buyer Credit).

The general process of arranging Supplier Credit is as follows:

1. Bank in US works with the US exporter and buyer to arrange financing.
2. Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the US exporter.
3. The US bank discounts the promissory note issued by the foreign buyer which is made payable to the US exporter.

The general process of arranging Buyer Credit is as follows:

1. Bank located in US works with the buyer and exporter to arrange financing.
2. Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the foreign buyer. Financing terms and conditions are based on the buyerâ€™s credit worthiness.
3. The US bank pays the US exporter on behalf of the foreign buyer.
