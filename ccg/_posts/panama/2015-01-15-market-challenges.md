Panamaâ€™s inflexible labor laws are a source of concern for prospective investors. Firing practices are excessively regulated, reducing labor mobility and inhibiting hiring. While inexpensive in global terms, Panama's minimum wage is relatively high in a Central American context. In addition, competent technical employees fluent in English may be hard to find. These labor issues, coupled with relatively high costs for electricity, result in higher than average unit production costs in Panama.

Instances of questionable government practices continue to affect U.S. investors in Panama. These include bidding procedures, contract obligations, and a slow and imperfect judicial system. The current administration has announced an ambitious agenda of fiscal reform, anti-corruption and transparency improvements, and reform of the Social Security system. With the exception of fiscal reform, however, there has been little to no progress on these fronts. Continued improvements in the areas of educational and judicial reform will be critical for Panama to improve its business competitiveness standing in the region.

International indexes generally rate Panama as one of the best countries in Latin America for business and investment. At the same time, however, U.S. investors have voiced concerns about corruption and inconsistent treatment. For these reasons we encourage U.S. companies interested in investing in Panama to read our report on [Investing in Panama](http://export.gov/panama/doingbusinessinpanama/investinginpanama/) thoroughly and to [contact us](http://export.gov/panama/contactus/) for more information. We also recommend that Americans interested in purchasing property in Panama review the U.S. Citizens Services [note.](http://panama.usembassy.gov/purchasing_property2.html)
