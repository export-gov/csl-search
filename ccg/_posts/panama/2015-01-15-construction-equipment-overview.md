The construction sector in Panama continues to be leading the growth of the national economy. A number of projects such as the $5.2 billion expansion of the Panama Canal, the completion of Panama’s bay cleaning project, some mining projects, the metro project, and the construction of a number of tourism and housing projects will keep the demand strong for heavy equipment and construction machinery for at least the next few years. For an overview of the Government of Panama’s plans in public infrastructure – which in addition to the Canal might amount to $15 billion in investments over the next 5 years – please visit the following link: [http://export.gov/panama/majorprojectsinpanama](http://export.gov/panama/majorprojectsinpanama).

U.S. construction equipment is well received because of its perceived quality and competitive price. U.S. products in this sector enjoy a market share of over 50%. Major competitors are Japan, Korea, Sweden and England. There are no significant restrictions on imported products. With implementation of the U.S. Free Trade Agreement with Panama expected in the coming year, we expect U.S. construction equipment to continue to be attractive to Panamanian buyers.
