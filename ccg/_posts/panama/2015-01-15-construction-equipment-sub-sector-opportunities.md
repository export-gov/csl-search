The expansion of the Panama Canal is generating a great demand for all kinds of construction equipment, especially excavators, off-road trucks, and all kind of earth moving equipment. The project entailed massive excavation on both ends of the Canal as well as the construction of the third set of locks capable of accommodating the Post-Panamax vessels. The $2 billion Metro project is well underway as well. And Canadian-based Inmet Mining has received environmental approval to go forward on a $6 billion copper mining investment, which will rival the Panama Canalâ€™s foreign earnings when complete.
