In the banking and finance sector, private entities generally give good marks to the Panamanian entities that regulate them, notably the Superintendent of Banks. U.S. businesses are concerned about the responsiveness and transparency of most regulating agencies. Authorities often fail to consult with affected parties before enacting new policies or implementing new legislation. In late 2008 and then again in 2011, the GOP started to change the rules governing the import and sale of refined petroleum products. Fuel importers did not consider the process to be fair and transparent.

In addition, regulatory uncertainty has become a hindrance to investment in the power generation sector. In late 2011, an American power generating firm had their concession revoked. In the last half of 2009, several U.S. companies believed regulatory agencies were seeking additional fees/taxes that were not contained in original contracts/concessions or were seeking to impose new taxes retroactively; for one American company, Standard and Poorâ€™s lowered the corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings, and also lowered the rating on $300 million senior notes to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'. S&P stated the downgrade was due to Panamanian government changes in the regulatory framework.
