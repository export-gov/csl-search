Panama has excellent air transportation facilities. Three major U.S. airlines serve the country, as well as others from different countries. COPA, the Panamanian airline, has a regional hub at the Tocumen International Airport, connecting Panama with major cities in the U.S. and Latin America.

Buses and taxis are readily available in urban areas. Taxi fares are low and usually range from US$ 2-10 depending on the trip's length. Congestion in the Panama City metro area is a rapidly increasing problem, but since the metro area is relatively compact, taxi service is the best way to get around.
 
The Government of Panama is executing a plan for a fully integrated bus and metro transit system to deal with the congestion.

Transportation from Tocumen International Airport into Panama City can be made by a special taxi service, with prices between US$ 30 - $35 depending on the size of the taxis. Taxis may be shared with other passengers. Car rentals are available. There is no bus service at the airport.

Major car rental companies operate in Panama and offer excellent services.

There is train service from Panama City to Colon, on the Atlantic side, operated by Kansas City Southern. This is primarily a container transportation facility but the railroad also operates limited passenger service. It has become an attractive tourism option to visit Colon.
