* **Consumer Retail Only.** No perishables and very little large capital equipment is sold through the CFZ. There is increasing activity for wholly owned regional distribution activity, as well as specialized third party logistics, handling products ranging from inexpensive shoes to high value pharmaceuticals. But for the most part, the products are basically what you would see in a U.S. shopping mall, from anchor stores through boutiques and specialty chains.

* **Some CFZ Merchants Should be Avoided.** Traditionally the CFZ, with its tradition of moving large amounts of merchandise and conducting some $18 billion annually of business, largely in cash, has had a bit of a frontier atmosphere. However, most of the business being conducted in the CFZ is entirely legitimate and the area inside the CFZ is very safe. The Commercial Service in Panama works closely with other sections of the U.S. Embassy to screen out merchants that should be avoided. We know the best merchants, and those merchants have every incentive to maintain their reputation. So please contact us before agreeing to conduct business with any merchant.

* **The Best CFZ Merchants Know Their Value.** If you think about the value that a solid merchant is offering you – a strong retail customer base, ability to offer terms, effective third party logistics co-located with significant transshipment operations – then you may need to be prepared to bargain hard for a margin that works for your business as well as the merchant’s. You are in a strong position if you can show solid sales in the U.S. already, but without an established history of top-line revenues, you would find negotiating with a good CFZ merchant to be a real challenge. 

* **We Can’t Assist You With non-U.S. Content.** Given the product range, it should come as no surprise that most of what is distributed through Colon is made in Asia these days. U.S. content participation ranges from 6-8%, even while U.S. branded content is much higher (think of Nike shoes, Columbia Sportswear, or General Electric electronics). If you have a product that is largely made outside of the U.S., we may not be able to assist you.

* **Brazil and Mexico Are Separate.** Brazil and Mexico both have large populations and an internal buying structure. You are better off pursuing a direct strategy there.
