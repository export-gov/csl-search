Because of its strategic location Panama is a key maritime center. The Panama Canal has historically been the symbol of Panama’s maritime activities. Panama’s traditional main ports, Cristobal on the Atlantic and Balboa on the Pacific, were privatized in the 1990s. Both ports are now modern facilities run by Hutchison Whampoa (Hong Kong) and are capable of handling increased container traffic. Additionally, two major container ports operate on the Atlantic: Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT), operated by the Seattle, WA-based Carrix, and Coco Solo operated by Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan). Port Singapore Authority (PSA) has recently initiated a new container port at the Pacific end of the Canal, close to Panama Pacifico’s extensive logistics parks. Panama’s container handling capability has increased from 250,000 in 1997 to over 5 million in 2011.

A trans-isthmian railroad, built by the U.S. firms Kansas City Southern and Mi-Jack Products Inc., has been in operation since 2001. The railroad allows for surface container multimodal transshipment. The Panamanian ports are among the most active ports in the region and this situation is expected to continue in the near future, as the world economy show signs of recovery.

The U.S. has a strong position in the port equipment market, with a market share of over 50 percent. Major competitors are Korea, Japan, Germany, and the People’s Republic of China.
