Success among distributors is often decided by quality of the training, counseling and support they receive from their principals. U.S. companies should focus on providing U.S.-level training and technical assistance to their distributors and making sure they have the resources to provide after-sales support, including spare parts, service equipment, and quality service to the customers. Note that U.S. companies enjoy a clear advantage over foreign competitors in this area. U.S. products are highly regarded and a pricing strategy should include explicit consideration of presenting the products as a lower cost-of-ownership solution that includes U.S.-caliber aftermarket servicing and maintenance. In doing so U.S. providers may be able to better counter lower cost competitors from China, for instance.
