Processing of customs documents in Panama for imports is fast, efficient and reliable. Merchandise imported into Panama must be cleared through customs by a customs broker licensed by the government of Panama. The following goods are imported under duty free status: those that are consigned to national or municipal governments, imported by foreign diplomats, consigned to the Panama Canal, sold to vessels transiting the Canal, or intended for re-export.

Basic import documentation required by the Panamanian Customs office includes:

* Import Declaration (prepared and signed by a customs broker).

* Commercial Invoice (original plus four copies to be presented in English or Spanish).

* Airway Bill.

* Bill of Lading (to be presented in triplicate).

* Commercial license number.

* Phytosanitary Certificate (In case of animal and plant products, to be obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture), and previous authorization from the Panamanian Food Safety Authority (AUPSA).

* Certificate of Free Sale (if required).

* Certificate of Origin (if required).

Any food product or other item used for human consumption (including for use on human skin or clothes) may be subject to the Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) documentation requirement. The main purpose of the CFS is to verify that a product is sold freely and used widely in the U.S. Potential exporters of items subject to the CFS documentation requirement may wish to contact the Food and Drug Administration, Division of Programs and Enforcement Policy, 200 C Street, SW, Washington, DC 20204. As of the date of this publication, the relevant FDA guidance can be found here: [http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125789.htm](http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125789.htm).

The bill of lading must be presented for the clearance of goods without exception. If for any reason any other required document cannot be presented within 24 hours after the shipment has arrived, clearance of the goods will be permitted by posting a bond equal to the amount of import duties. The bond is canceled if the prescribed documents are presented in due form within a period of 90 days. The bond may be extended in justified cases, an additional 90 days.
