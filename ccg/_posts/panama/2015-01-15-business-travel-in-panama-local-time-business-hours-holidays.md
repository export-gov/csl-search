Panama does not observe Daylight Savings Time. So from roughly April – October, it is one hour behind U.S. East Coast Time. From November – March, it is at the same time as the U.S. East Coast.

Private business offices are open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and Saturdays from 8:00 a.m. to 12 noon. Banks are open from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Most local banks open Saturdays from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 Noon. Government offices are open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.

All private, government, municipal and U.S. Embassy offices are closed during local holidays. In addition the U.S. Mission observes all U.S. holidays.
