Television and newspaper advertising are the promotion tools of choice for the majority of distributors of U.S. products. E-mail marketing is becoming increasingly popular, especially for services. Panama has a very competitive advertising market, with standardized pricing and very good production quality. Additionally, trade shows, specialized seminars and exhibitions are effective tools for trade promotion. Special sale prices during events such as Mother’s and Father’s Day, Back-to-School, and Easter are usually advertised in newspapers during weekends.

Most foreign manufacturers of consumer products maintain a high profile presence in the country through newspaper ads, large billboards, sponsored sports events, and TV advertising. Web based advertising and company promotion is gaining popularity. Radio advertising is mainly used outside of the Panama City metropolitan area.
