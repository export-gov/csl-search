The Vice Ministry of Foreign Trade (VICOMEX) was created in 1998 to promote exports and investment. It facilitates the processing of export documentation through a "One Stop" (Ventanilla Unica) office that can reduce the export process to a few hours.
 
Export documentation required by Panamanian customs authorities includes:

* Commercial invoice.

* Export declaration (usually prepared and signed by a customs broker).

* Certificate of Origin (issued by the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Panama, VICOMEX, or SIP/Sindicato de Industriales de Panama and approved by VICOMEX).

* Bill of Lading.

* Airway Bill.

* Veterinary, Sanitary or Phytosanitary Certificate (when applicable).

There is no requirement to use export brokers for export documentation.
