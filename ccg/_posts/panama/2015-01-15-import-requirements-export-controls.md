The Fiscal Code regulates all matters concerning the country's exports. The Code establishes that all national products may be exported, except:

* Drugs, with the exception of those having pharmaceutical or scientific purposes.

* Staple products determined by the government to be temporarily scarce in the country.
 
* Those products the Panamanian government decides not to export for reasons of international agreements or for the economic interest of the country.

Law 61 of 2002 abolished the requirement for some exports (primarily metals and natural resources) to pay taxes.
