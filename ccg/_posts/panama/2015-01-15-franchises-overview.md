The Franchising sector in Panama offers excellent opportunities for U.S. companies. Panama is highly receptive to U.S. franchise concepts and the economy is showing excellent and consistent growth.

Foreign franchises comprise 95 percent of the total number of franchises in the country. The U.S. is the market leader but competition is increasing from other countries such as Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, and some European countries. Competitive prices, product quality, and strong promotion are the main factors determining successful market penetration. There are no major restrictions for franchise operations in Panama. Because the U.S. Dollar is legal tender in Panama and there are well-developed banking systems, business transactions are substantially easier than in other countries. Most banks are familiar with the franchise business.
