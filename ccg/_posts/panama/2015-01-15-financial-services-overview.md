Panama is an international banking center and this area continues to be one of the most dynamic parts of the economy. As of December 2011, Panama's 93 banks reported total assets of US$73 billion, a 3 percent increase over 2010. In 2011, approximately 9 percent of the total credit portfolio represented loans to the public sector. Loans to the private sector in Panama reached US20 billion, or 96 percent of total credit. The three largest loan sectors were trade and commerce, mortgages, and consumer lending (79 percent of total credit to the private sector).

Panama uses the US dollar as its legal tender, which has contributed to historically low inflation for Latin America. Credit is widely available at relatively low rates for Panamanian businesses and individuals purchasing such large ticket items as houses and cars.

The Government of Panama allows three classes of operations. General License banks operate full service banks in Panama and compete for domestic deposits and loans. International License ("Offshore") banks can only accept deposits from persons or organizations located overseas. Representative Offices can only perform representational activities. There are also two state-owned deposit-taking institutions. Foreign and Panamanian banks compete on equal terms. Banks are members of the Panamanian Banking Association (Panamanian and Foreign Banks) and are licensed and regulated by the Banking Supervisory Authority (Superintendencia de Bancos). Panamaâ€™s banking system does not have a deposit insurance scheme.
