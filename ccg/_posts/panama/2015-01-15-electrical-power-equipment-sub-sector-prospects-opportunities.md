The Government of Panama passed Law No. 45 of August 4, 2004 to provide a number of incentives for the construction and development of new electric generation plants, especially hydroelectric plants (up to 20 MW) and other clean energy sources. Also, a new law to promote wind power generation was passed in 2011.
