        <p>Green building products that meet the new energy efficiency standards in new, unique or economically competitive ways have a potential market in China. Some of the best prospects for China's market are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green-design techniques</li>
<li>HVAC systems</li>
<li>Solar products</li>
<li>Grey water, water reuse systems, and landscape materials</li>
<li>New building materials</li>
<li>New technologies &amp; products</li>
</ul>


<p>According to the China Greentech Initiative Report, the following building materials are the target energy efficient products in China.
* Concrete: slag cement and fly ash content; autoclaved aerated concrete
* Insulation: Expanded (EPS) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS)
* Roofing: Reflective Systems Vegetated Roofs TPO membranes
* Windows and Doors: double-glazed low-solar-gain Low-E Glass
* Lighting: T series light fixtures CFL and LED bulbs
* HVAC: absorption chillers, variable frequency drives (VFD), energy recovery wheels, air purifying equipment
* In door building materials: low-emission, thermal and noise reduction, and insulation
* Integrated design</p>

<p>On December 2010, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, MOHURD, and the State of Energy Bureau jointly announced government subsidies for solar roofing systems to promote the development of solar products in China. Due to China's geographical structure, heat preservation, insulation, translucence, and ventilation are very important in China's different regions. For example, in northern China, it is imperative to reduce the amount of energy used via heating supply. Improvements to heat preservation in new and old buildings are vital to achieving this goal. New types of energy conservation products, such as wall-structure preservation products, and heat supply measuring systems have been used extensively in these areas.</p>
