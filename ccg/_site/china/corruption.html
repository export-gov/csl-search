        <p>Corruption remains endemic in China. Sectors requiring extensive government approval are the most affected, including banking, finance and construction. The lack of an independent press as well as the fact that all bodies responsible for conducting corruption investigations are controlled by the Communist Party hamper anti-corruption efforts. Senior officials and family members are suspected of using connections to avoid investigation or prosecution for alleged misdeeds.</p>

<p>According to Chinese law, accepting a bribe is a criminal offence with a maximum punishment of life in prison or death in "especially serious" circumstances. The maximum punishment for offering a bribe to a Chinese official is five years in prison, except when there are "serious" or "especially serious" circumstances, when punishment can range from five years to life in prison. A February 2011 amendment to the Penal Code made offering large bribes to foreign officials or officials of international organizations a punishable offense.</p>

<p>The Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security investigate criminal violations of laws related to anti-corruption, while the Ministry of Supervision and the Communist Party Discipline Inspection Committee enforce ethics guidelines and party discipline. China's National Audit Office also inspects accounts of state-owned enterprises and government entities.</p>

<p>China ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2005 and participates in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anti-corruption initiatives. China has not signed the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery.</p>
