        <p>Mandarin Chinese is the national language, spoken by over 70 percent of Chinese. Other than Mandarin there are six major Chinese dialects, as well as numerous local dialects. Pinyin refers to the standardized Romanization system used to represent the pronunciation of Chinese characters; it is used throughout China on signs. Chinese characters are all written the same, but are pronounced differently in each dialect. China employs simplified characters but most areas outside the Mainland, including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Southeast Asia, use traditional characters. For business purposes it is important to provide contacts with bilingual business cards, usually with Chinese characters on one side, English on the other. Titles and company names should be translated with care into Chinese to ensure a positive meaning.</p>
