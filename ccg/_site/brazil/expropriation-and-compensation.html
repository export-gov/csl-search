        <p>There have been no expropriation actions in Brazil against foreign interests in the recent past, nor have there been any signs that the current government is contemplating such actions. In the past, some claims regarding land expropriations by state agencies have been judged by Brazilian courts in U.S. citizensâ€™ favor. However, compensation has not always been paid as states have filed appeals to these decisions and the Brazilian judicial system moves slowly.</p>
