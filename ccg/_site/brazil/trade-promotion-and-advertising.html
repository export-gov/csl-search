        <p>With its well-established and diversified industrial sector, Brazil has a variety of specialized publications that can provide excellent advertising outlets that target a multitude of trade and consumer audiences. TV advertising can be an especially important marketing channel for Brazil’s growing consumer base. The top advertising categories by expenditure are trade and commerce, consumer services, culture, leisure, sports and tourism, media, and public and social services.</p>

<p>The most popular magazine in Brazil, with a circulation of over one million copies, is the weekly <em>Veja</em>, published by the Abril Publishing Company. The nation’s largest daily circulation newspaper is <em>Folha de São Paulo</em>, published by the Folha Group, with a circulation of 400,000 on Sundays and a daily circulation of 317,000 from Monday through Saturday.</p>

<p>Trade fairs are another important marketing tool. The city of São Paulo hosts around 300 trade fairs per year. Other principal cities host significant shows as well: Rio de Janeiro for the oil and gas industry, and Belo Horizonte for mining. These events attract many visitors and exhibitors from Brazil and foreign countries. Specialists from the U.S. Commercial Service Brazil participate in many of these events, and can help you arrange meetings with potential agents, distributors, lawyers, and customers at these trade shows. Some of the most important trade shows in Brazil are listed by industry in various sections of #Chapter 4.</p>
