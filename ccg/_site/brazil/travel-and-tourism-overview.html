        <p>Brazil has recently surpassed Germany as the 3rd largest source of overseas visitors to the United States (excluding Canada and Mexico), and is the top arrivals market from South America. Brazil accounts for more than 30% of all arrivals in the United States from that continent.</p>

<p>With both the fifth largest land mass and population in the world, recent economic growth, and a growing middle class, the nation of Brazil accounts for ever-increasing numbers of visitors to the US; totals are expected to continue significantly increases for years to come. At a major travel and tourism awards event in Brazil in 2013, the U.S. was recognized as the #1 destination of choice for first-time Brazilian international travelers and the destination of choice for Brazilians that have yet to make their first trip abroad.</p>

<p>In 2010, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Travel and Tourism Industry (OTTI) reported that Brazil had a 34% increase in the number of arrivals to the United States, reaching a record 1,197,000 visitors. The rate of growth continued in 2011, when 1,508,279 Brazilians visited the United States, representing an increase of 26% over the previous year. Arrivals from Brazil in 2012 reached 1,791,103 visitors, an 18.8% increase over 2011. In 2013, more than 2 million Brazilian travelers visited the U.S., a 15% increase over 2012:</p>

<p>Spending by Brazilian visitors to the United States continues to grow every year. In 2012, Brazilians accounted for US$9.3 billion in expenditures while staying in the U.S., or more than US$5,000 per visitor. Expenditures by Brazilians in the United States in 2013 reached a record-breaking number of $10.5 billion.</p>

<p>The US Department of Commerce expects the total number of Brazilian visitors to the U.S. will increase to even higher levels by the end of 2014. In 2012, the State Department added more consular officers at its visa issuing posts in Brazil to speed up the visa application process.</p>

<p>It is notable that São Paulo is one of the top three visa issuing U.S. Embassy/consulate posts in the world. In 2013, Brazil issued more than 1.1 million U.S. visas; more than 50% of those visas were adjudicated at Consulate São Paulo.</p>
