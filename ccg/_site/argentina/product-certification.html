        <p><strong>Mandatory Testing and Mandatory Product Certification</strong></p>

<p>Regulated products must display an official safety "S" mark to show they conform to the regulations. However, as described above and due to implementation issues, it is difficult to state with certainty at this time the products that must be tested, certified, and marked as required by the resolutions.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Mandatory Testing and Product Certification</strong></p>

<p>There is no legal mandate to retest non-regulated products that have been approved in their country of origin. For non-regulated products, some U.S. trademarks and product certifications are well known and accepted in Argentina. As with standards, any certification that may be required for non-regulated sectors is a contractual matter to be decided between the buyer and the seller. However, it is important to be aware that market conditions and preferences may impose the use of particular standards, certification, or trademarks.</p>

<p>Traditionally, product certification in Argentina has been mostly voluntary with few active organizations, including IRAM. However, this has changed due to the partial implementation of regulations that mandate product certification. A number of U.S. certification bodies are now active in Argentina, along with several multinationals and new local entities.</p>

<p>INTI is a government agency that participates in standards development and performs product testing and certification. Due to the continuing shortage of independent laboratories in Argentina, INTI is viewed as a prime testing and calibration laboratory for the country.</p>

<p>INTI's position attracts interest and substantial technical support and cooperation from foreign countries, most notably Germany, Japan, and the U.K. These, and other countries such as France, regularly offer scholarships for long- and medium-term training courses abroad. Other Argentine private and public organizations also benefit from third country largesse.</p>

<p>To facilitate acceptance of U.S. products in the Argentine market, agreements between U.S. and local certifiers and testing houses are encouraged. This could provide recognition of existing certifications. Also, there is no impediment for U.S. certification organizations to be established and accredited in Argentina.</p>

<p>The GOA, specifically the Dirección de Lealtad Comercial office, introduced a change in the certification rules. All certification bodies that issue S-Mark certificates through recognition of testing done outside of Argentina now have to perform “accreditation of coincidence between the product intended to be marketed in Argentina and the one contained in the certificate issued abroad” and issue an official notification to that effect. The measure means having the distributor import a sample for a visual inspection before issuing the certificate or extension to the importer. This applies to all electrical products (under the scope of resolution 92/98). In fact, this requirement is now mandatory for all electrical products regardless if they belong to the same “family” of products; in the past they were exempted from this inspection. In addition, the “visual inspection” is now required to be coordinated by the laboratory, inviting an officer from Lealtad Comercial to the importer’s warehouse. Please note that this new requirement may change so for further information please contact <a href="Marina.Millet@trade.gov">Marina.Millet@trade.gov</a>.</p>
