        <p>There are two types of traditional sales channels in Argentina. One is through large-scale retailers with a defined but limited share of the market. The other is through the many specialized retailers that seek to protect their niches.</p>

<p>The food retail market is loosely separated into three categories: traditional "mom and pop" stores scattered throughout local neighborhoods, self-service mini-markets and drugstores, and the supermarkets and hypermarkets. Consumers prefer hypermarkets and supermarkets for lower prices on weekly and monthly purchases.</p>
