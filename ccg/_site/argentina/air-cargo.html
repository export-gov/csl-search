        <p><a href="http://www.tca.aero/">Terminal de Cargas Argentina (TCA)</a> was created as a concessionary partnership established by the GOA for the operation of airfreight terminals at international airports. TCA provides full logistics and storage services to all foreign cargo agents. TCA's primary business is bonded warehouse management at major Argentine international airports, where the company stores imported and exported cargo while their consignees perform relevant formalities with the General Customs Administration or <em><a href="http://www.afip.gov.ar/aduanaDefault.asp">Dirección General de Aduanas (DGA)</a></em>. TCA's headquarters are located at Ezeiza Airport (Argentina’s main international airport just outside of Buenos Aires). The company also has branches in Córdoba, Mendoza, Mar del Plata, and Jorge Newbery Domestic Airport, in Buenos Aires City. Air cargo imports have grown rapidly in the past years. International courier delivery services are extremely active and most global express delivery firms have significant operations in Argentina, including FedEx, DHL, and UPS.</p>
