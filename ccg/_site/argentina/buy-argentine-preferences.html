The origin of the goods shall be determined by the nature/composition of the goods themselves, not based on the nationality or ownership of the manufacturing company. Goods containing imported parts shall be considered domestically produced when the value of the imported parts is no more than 40 percent of the sales value of the finished good, or when the imported product undergoes substantial in-country transformation such that the MERCOSUR tariff classification code of the transformed item differs from that of the imported part.</p>

<p><em>Public Works</em>: Preference will be given to domestic materials and to domestic services (i.e., project design, management, and construction services) as defined above.</p>
