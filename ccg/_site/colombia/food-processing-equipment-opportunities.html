        <p>The recent influx of economic data regarding foreign direct investment and a decrease in unemployment show that Colombia is on its way to perform at all-time highs in terms of economic activity.</p>

<p>Market opportunities for U.S. manufacturers vary broadly, determined by equipment size and production capacity. Although there are a significant number of large food processors capable of handling large production capacity (such as SAB Miller-Bavaria, Nacional de Chocolates, Colombina, Postobon and Frito Lay), the largest segment with the highest purchasing potential is the Small- and Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) group, which requires less installed capacity.</p>

<p>Competition from local equipment producers in this sector is minimal. The quality of local technology has improved for basic equipment and spare parts manufacturing. Local production is still undeveloped when compared to the United States and other countries.</p>

<p>This is especially true in terms of competing with the latest technologies such as nanotechnology and electronic/robotics used for production/packaging lines. The May 2012 implementation of the FTA emphasized the importance of improving the competitiveness of this sector. The FTA eliminated the five to 15 percent Colombian tariffs on U.S. products for this industry and will significantly increase the competitiveness of U.S. food machinery and packaging equipment in the Colombian market.</p>
