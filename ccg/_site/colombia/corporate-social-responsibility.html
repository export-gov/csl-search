        <p>Colombia adheres to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) principles outlined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. It has a long tradition of CSR across many industries and encourages public and private enterprises to follow OECD guidelines. Beneficiaries of CSR programs include students, children, populations vulnerable to Colombia's armed conflict, victims of violence, and the environment. Larger companies, in particular, structure their CSR programs in line with generally accepted international CSR principles. On several occasions, companies in Colombia have been recognized on an international level, including by the State Department, for their CSR commitments.</p>

<p>Overall, Colombia has strong environmental laws on the books, is proactive at the federal level in enacting environmental protections, and does not waive labor or environmental regulations to attract investors. However, the Colombian government struggles with enforcement, particularly in more remote areas. Geography, lack of infrastructure, and lack of state presence all play a role, as does a general shortage of resources in its national and regional level institutions. The Environmental Chapter of the CTPA requires Colombia to maintain and enforce environmental laws, protect biodiversity, and promote opportunities for public participation.</p>
