        <p>U.S. exporters should be aware that the U.S. Government may prohibit the export of certain products to Colombia or require an export license. The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Office of Export Enforcement licenses most controlled product and technology exports. Licenses are required for certain high technology items or technology transfers and items with dual use potential (commercial items which could have military applications). In recent years there have been increased restrictions on the export of precursor chemicals to Colombia, due to concerns they may be utilized by narcotics traffickers to produce drugs. For more information on U.S. export compliance and enforcement licensing issues contact BIS: Tel: (202) 482- 1208, (800) 424-2980, or web site - <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov">http://www.bis.doc.gov</a> . For information on the export of defense articles, weapons, and firearms contact the State Department’s Defense Trade Controls Directorate (DDTC), Tel: (202) 663-2700, Fax.
