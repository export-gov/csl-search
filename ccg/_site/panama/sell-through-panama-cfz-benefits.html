        <p>U.S. consumer retail companies using this method of export to Latin America could:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Save Time.</strong> Instead of traveling to every Latin American country where there might be export prospects, talking with merchants, agents, representatives, and distributors, you would only need to go to one location – Panama, which is highly accessible given its prominence as a regional air hub.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grow Sales.</strong> Because the CFZ is the world’s second largest free trade zone, with exports of $10 billion and growing, retailers from many countries in Latin America simply schedule regular shopping trips to CFZ merchants. When they order, they order in wholesale quantities – the target retailer buying in the CFZ is frequently a department store owner with 10-15 stores in his country of origin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce Complexity.</strong> You sell in dollars to a CFZ merchant. The entry is duty free. And you are only selling to one entity – therefore you only have one relationship to manage. Finally, the CFZ is co-located with some of the world’s largest transshipment ports, meaning that it is easy for merchants to pick and pack customized shipments to any one of a number of otherwise small Latin American ports of entry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce Financial Risk/Make More Money.</strong> You are selling to established CFZ merchants. They in turn make their money by showcasing your products. They know their customers and are able to offer financial terms based on creditworthiness. These terms in turn allow you to sell more product instead of having to bear the risk of offering terms or losing the sale. In addition, you do not have any duties to pay – those end up being the responsibility of the final buyer once your goods enter that country. And finally, you are outsourcing the regional distribution to an expert. It is if you had, in a good CFZ merchant, a representative, financier, and third party distributor all rolled up into one, not only for Panama but for Latin America.</p></li>
</ul>
