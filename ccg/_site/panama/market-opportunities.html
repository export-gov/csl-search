        <p>Panama has no restrictions on the outflow of capital or outward direct investment. Its accession to the World Trade Organization in mid-1997 opened up trade and lowered tariffs across the board, giving Panama the lowest average tariff rate in Latin America. Panama’s recognition of the U.S. sanitary and phytosanitary system and the creation of a new Food Safety Authority have essentially eliminated the previous slow and arbitrary procedures for issuing phytosanitary permits for U.S. food products.</p>

<p>Consumer attitudes and many brand preferences are similar to the U.S. U.S. television, radio and magazines are all available and popular in Panama. Panamanians frequently travel to the U.S. for vacation, medical treatment, study and business. Their buying patterns and tastes are similar to those of U.S. consumers.</p>

<p>U.S. goods and services enjoy a reputation for high quality and are highly competitive. Panama has in recent years established itself as a regional competitor to Miami for consumer retail, which may result in a larger market than its domestic population would indicate. The country boasts the highest per capita GDP in the region. However, income distribution is highly skewed toward a relatively small, consumer goods-oriented, economically powerful class. This class enjoys a very high level of disposable income. They prefer high quality trend-setting goods where price is a secondary determinant in the purchasing decision.</p>

<p>The expansion of the Panama Canal – a US$5.25 billion project that will double capacity and allow passage of larger post-Panamax vessels - was approved in a national referendum in 2006 and started in 2007. The Government of Panama sees this project as essential to maintaining its stature in global transport and hopes to complete it in 2014. When completed, the project will have a significant impact on U.S. ports, which are already positioning themselves to take advantage of the expansion.</p>

<p>An interesting area for foreign investment is in the former Canal Zone and associated military bases. One of the largest facilities, the former Howard Air Force Base, is being developed into a “new town” with offices, light warehousing, apartments, homes along with shops and restaurants, all within a special economic incentive zone. A number of anchor U.S. clients, e.g. Dell, 3M, Caterpillar, and W.R. Grace, have established growing operations in this area.</p>

<p>Panama is on record as being in favor of free trade agreements (FTAs) and is currently working to implement a Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) with the U.S. that will result in tariffs immediately dropping to zero for approximately 87% of U.S. exports, with the remainder phased out over time. Panama has full FTAs with El Salvador, Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Peru and Nicaragua; and partial FTAs with Mexico, Dominican Republic and Cuba. Panama is in the process of implementing an FTA with the European Union while an FTA with Canada is pending ratification by the Canadian Parliament.</p>
