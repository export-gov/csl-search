        <p>When a bidder offers to supply foreign goods not available in country, they must guarantee "nationalization" of the goods by depositing a bond on behalf of the contracting party. In addition, the Secretariat of Industry will issue a certificate verifying the value of the goods to be purchased abroad at the request of the contracting party within 96 hours of receiving said request. To obtain the Certificate of Verification (<em>Certificado De Verificaci√≥n-CDV</em>), the contracting party must submit a sworn statement declaring (1) that it has complied with the <em>Compre Argentino</em> regime; (2) the end price or value of the foreign goods; and (3) that said price or value is lower than that of domestic goods offered or that no domestic goods were offered.</p>
