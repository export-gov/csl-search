        <p>Letters of credit (L/Cs) may be used to pay for U.S. exports to Argentina. A number of banks in Argentina open L/Cs once the bank has approved a line of credit for the Argentine company. Multinationals, large, and medium sized firms are still the main users of L/Cs, although small firms use them to a lesser degree.</p>

<p>Another payment option is direct payment from the Argentine importers’ overseas bank account, but given the current regulatory framework governing trade and foreign exchange, the use of overseas accounts may not be the preferred means of payment by the Argentine importer. Bank drafts and documentary collections are commonly used. While they do help safeguard the U.S. exporter's title to goods until payment has been received, all credit and country risk remains with the exporter. There is no obligation for the bank to cover these risks. However, documentary collections are less costly than L/Cs and, where the exporter is comfortable with these risks; they offer a practical and efficient solution, particularly for Argentine subsidiaries of U.S. companies.</p>

<p>Most sales to Argentine importers currently take place on open accounts. Small- and medium-sized Argentine companies in key sectors with appropriate liquidity invest in technological upgrades in production lines. As a result, open account sales generally take place between small- and medium-sized firms. U.S. exporters should consider open account payment terms only if they have a great deal of trust in the local importer and feel confident in the clients’ ability and willingness to pay.</p>

<p>However, imports are subject to changes in Argentine Government policy that cannot be foreseen. There have been a small number of cases in which the Argentine importer was unable to move foreign exchange out of the country due to a dispute with Argentine authorities over prior transactions involving foreign exchange. It is therefore advisable that in cases where the U.S. exporter would suffer significant hardship due to a delay in payment by the Argentine importer resulting from unforeseen disputes with Argentine authorities or changes in Government policy, that the export be secured with confirmed L/Cs.</p>
