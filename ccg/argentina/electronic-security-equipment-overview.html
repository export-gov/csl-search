        <p>In 2012, the Argentine electronic security sector market was valued at approximately $645 million dollars, making it a relatively large and growing sector for U.S. firms, especially in electronic security-related products, equipment, and services.</p>

<p>Despite the economic challenges facing the global economy, the electronic security sector in Argentina grew 31 percent in 2012. Local trade contacts estimate growth of 20 to 30 percent in 2013. This increase is largely attributed to rising crime, the high levels of perceived insecurity, and the increasing priority of improving workplace safety. This expansion has been seen in all sub-sectors of products and services of electronic security, especially for monitoring, CCTV over IP, intrusion control and law enforcement equipment, together totaling over 80 percent of electronic security imports to Argentina.</p>

<p>Hi-tech imports play a significant role in the overall security market, as domestic manufacturing is primarily focused on the production of basic security equipment and safety supplies. Thus, the hi-tech security equipment market presents the greatest opportunities for U.S. companies. The greatest potential for growth lies in such applications as online digital video surveillance and intelligent software with capabilities such as pausing, zooming, identification of specific objects and persons through facial expressions, thermal and night vision features.</p>

<p>2013 Sector Highlights:</p>

<p>• Important investments in device research and updating.</p>

<p>• Constant growth according to technological development. Greater awareness with regards to the relationship between ICT and Electronic Security.</p>

<p>• Increasing development and specialization per product or service offered.</p>

<p>• Argentina has outstanding human and technical resources in the security area.</p>

<p>• In the coming years market growth is expected as a result of the emergence of new technologies and better access possibilities for companies and users.</p>

<p>• Important development of activity segments with strong demand such as mining companies, oil companies, airports, as well as the development of intelligent buildings, urban monitoring and new regulations in the banking sector.</p>
