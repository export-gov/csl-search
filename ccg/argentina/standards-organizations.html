        <p>There are two private sector organizations that work under the National System for Standards, Quality and Certification (IRAM). IRAM is the official national standards body for the Republic of Argentina. The Argentine Accreditation Organization (OAA) is the accreditation body. These are the only organizations that carry out standardization and accreditation in Argentina. As of May 2013 there are Mutual Recognition Agreements between major foreign certification organizations and IRAM. However, it is recommended that exporters check the current status of these agreements prior to initiating new business arrangements or significant shipments of goods that require IRAM certification.</p>
