        <p>The certificate of origin is a document required by Argentine Customs under various circumstances:</p>

<p><em>Control of Preferential Origin</em></p>

<p>To claim preferential import duties when the country of origin has signed a trade agreement endorsing these preferences, as is the case of imports from member countries of MERCOSUR or the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). The Argentine Customs authorities will require this document to grant preferential treatment at the importer’s request.</p>

<p><em>Control of Non-Preferential Origin</em></p>

<p>The government of Argentina also requires a certificate of origin for certain products, such as textiles and footwear, regardless of their country of origin (Resolution MEOSP 39/96).</p>

<p>This control is in place to address import issues such as:</p>

<p>• Antidumping Duties</p>

<p>• Countervailing Measures</p>

<p>• Safeguard Measures</p>

<p>• Import Quotas</p>

<p>• Trade Statistics</p>

<p>The certificate of origin requires the authorized signature of the local Chamber of Commerce Secretary in the U.S. and the seal of that organization and also must be legalized by the Argentine consulate in the U.S. Note that if the product to be shipped contains components material manufactured in another country, the U.S. company must obtain signatures of the relevant chambers in those countries and have the document legalized by the Argentine consulates in those countries.</p>
