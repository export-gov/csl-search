        <p>A 1994 decree created the legal framework (Decree 1474/94) for standards-related activities in Argentina.</p>

<p>As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Argentina signed the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), affirming its obligations relative to technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures. The Argentine Standards Institute (IRAM) has signed the WTO TBT Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards. Responsibilities under the TBT agreement include the establishment of a national inquiry point to serve as a central location for information on standards-related issues, including proposed mandatory regulations. The Argentine inquiry point is in the Secretariat of Industry (see Information Sources below). The U.S. inquiry point is the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/director/sco/ncsci/">National Center for Standards and Certification Information (NCSCI)</a>, located at National Institute of Standards and Technology (see Information Sources below).</p>

<p><strong>Standards and Regulations in MERCOSUR</strong></p>

<p>Argentina, as an active MERCOSUR member, participates in the development of MERCOSUR standards and regulations. The MERCOSUR Standards Association, Asociación MERCOSUR de Normalización, previously known as the <em>Comité MERCOSUR de Normalización</em> (AMN) ― composed of the standards institutes of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay ― develops and harmonizes standards. The Executive Secretariat of the AMN is located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Voluntary standards are developed in 16 technical committees and deal mostly with steel products, cement and concrete, and electrical safety. Several hundred standards are at different stages of preparation or in the work plan. Venezuela will participate in this activity, as well, as a full member of MERCOSUR.</p>

<p>Regional technical regulations are developed and/or harmonized by the MERCOSUR governments in Sub Working Group 3 in the following fields: automotive, foods, metrology, safety issues for electrical products, toys, and pre-measured products. Separate working groups, such as those on telecommunications and health issues, also focus on mandatory technical requirements for their particular sectors. Approved MERCOSUR regulations are not automatically applicable in each country. To be applicable, harmonized MERCOSUR regulations must be adopted by each country. The four countries generally adopt all MERCOSUR regulations, though at different speeds.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural and Health-related Products</strong></p>

<p>Please note that agricultural and health-related products are subject to specific and different voluntary standards and mandatory technical regulations. Medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and foods are the purview of ANMAT.</p>
