<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A Letter of Credit is a legal document issued by a bank (domestic or foreign) that assures payment based upon the performance of certain documentary conditions and requirements by the US exporter as stipulated within the terms of the buyerâ€™s credit. The added confirmation by a US bank means that a US bank will pay the US exporter when the Letter of Credit is presented to them in the US. The US bank will then demand the funds from the Latin American bank because the US bank has confirmed the US exporter has performed according to the terms of the Letter of Credit. It is important to note that the actual wording of the Letter of Credit document is subject to negotiation between the buyer, exporter and their banks.</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Although Confirmed LCs are a very secure form of payment, many US exporters lose sales and / or sell less to Latin America due to their insistence on either Confirmed LCs or Cash in Advance. While great care must be taken when selling to any foreign buyer, other less secure forms of payment should be considered by US exporters if a given buyer is particularly creditworthy or other forms of security, such as export credit insurance, are available.</p>

<p>The cost of a Confirmed LC of less than one year does not generally drop in Latin America. Accordingly, for short-term transactions, the cost is particularly expensive relative to the term. For example, a Latin American company purchasing $100,000 in goods from a US exporter will pay between $3,000 and $4,000 for a confirmed LC regardless of whether it is for 90 days or 1 year.</p>
