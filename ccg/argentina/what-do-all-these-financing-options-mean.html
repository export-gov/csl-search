        <p>Each of these options will be covered in some detail in separate sections. We show you a short table that gives you an idea of whether the financing mechanism is appropriate for the sale you want to make. We point out the advantages and disadvantages of each, both for you as a US exporter and for your Latin American buyer. There’s a diagram that shows you how the financing is structured. And, where appropriate, we add comments and examples to make each option even clearer.</p>

<p><strong>This guide is just the first step</strong></p>

<p>However, please note that this guide is meant to give you, the US exporter, a preliminary overview. A variety of issues are not considered. Once you’re ready to take the next step, we encourage you to contact us through our website at <a href="www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/">www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/</a>. Our sector-specific contacts are listed there and are ready to assist you.</p>
