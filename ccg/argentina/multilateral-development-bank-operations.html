        <p>The <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/EXTIBRD/0,,menuPK:3046081~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3046012,00.html">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)</a> provides funding for projects in Argentina. It also provides technical assistance and policy advice. IBRD raises money through the sale of AAA-rated bonds in international capital markets. Loans are made only to governments or to agencies that can obtain a government guarantee. The IBRD also provides partial risk or partial credit guarantees (with a counter-guarantee from their government) to private lenders on development projects. The interest rates are variable, set at half a percentage point above the Bank's average cost of borrowing or LIBOR. Repayment is usually 12-15 years, including a grace period of three to five years. Opportunities exist for U.S. companies to supply goods and services financed by these loans.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation (IFC)</a>, an affiliate of the World Bank, also provides project financing for private investment in Argentina. IFC offers long-term loans, equity investments, and other financing services. IFC will generally invest up to 25 percent of the total project cost. Besides project finance, IFC also provides legal and technical assistance to private enterprises. Unlike the IBRD, the IFC does not require government guarantees. U.S. companies seeking direct investment funds should <a href="http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/regions/latin+america+and+the+caribbean/contacts/lac+contacts+default+landing+page">contact the IFC</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.miga.org/">Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)</a> was established in April 1988 to help investors address problems of political risk. Investors' concerns about political risk slowed the flow of foreign direct investment, which in turn slowed the creation of jobs and the transfer of modern technology. MIGA's purpose is to promote the flow of foreign direct investment among member countries by insuring investments against non-commercial (political) risk and by providing promotional and advisory services to help member countries create an attractive investment climate. U.S. companies seeking investment guarantees should <a href="http://www.miga.org/contact/index.cfm">contact MIGA</a>. NOTE: The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) also provides investment guarantees - more information below.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iadb.org/">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> also provides financial support to projects in Argentina at similar interest rates and with similar repayment terms. The relationship between the <a href="http://www.iic.int/home.asp">Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC)</a> and the IDB is similar to that of the IFC and the World Bank.</p>
