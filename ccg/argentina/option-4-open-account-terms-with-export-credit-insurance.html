        <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>The transaction is exactly the same as that of Open Account except that the US exporter purchases Export Credit Insurance and the Credit Insurer agrees to reimburse the US exporter up to 90% of the value of the receivable in the event that the Latin American buyer declares bankruptcy, defaults on payment or cannot pay due to one of a variety of political risks.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that some Credit Insurance policies provide broader coverage than others. Use of a specialist Credit Insurance broker is highly recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Open account sales covered by Export Credit Insurance are considered by many to strike an excellent balance between prudence and the desire to provide competitive payment terms that won’t undermine sales. The costs associated with Export Credit Insurance are minimal when compared to the costs of Confirmed Letters of Credit. Generally an exporter can charge back the minimal insurance costs to their buyers by increasing their prices from between the 0.08% to 1.5% in accordance with the cost of their insurance program.</p>

<p>Open account terms with Credit Insurance are more secure than simple unsecured open account terms. However, they are not considered as secure as Cash In Advance or Confirmed LC, as Export Credit Insurance is a conditional guarantee that includes certain conditions and exclusions. For example, a typical Export Credit Insurance policy excludes payment in the event of a dispute between the buyer and seller until the dispute is resolved. Due to the complexity of Export Credit Insurance and the fact that policy terms and conditions vary dramatically among insurers, the use of an insurance broker with specialized experience with Credit Insurance is highly recommended.</p>

<p>The US Export Credit Insurance market is competitive. There are currently eight principal Credit Insurers available to US Exporters:</p>

<ol>
<li>AIG;</li>
<li>Atradius (NCM);</li>
<li>Chubb;</li>
<li>Coface;</li>
<li>Euler Hermes;</li>
<li>Export  –  Import  Bank  of  the  United States (Ex-Im Bank);</li>
<li>FCIA;</li>
<li>Zurich.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the past many US exporters found that Export Credit Insurers were reluctant to approve key buyers in Latin America. While this was indeed the case, Export Credit Insurers are increasingly willing to assume risk in the region.</p>

<p>For many Small and Medium Sized US Exporters who export to Latin America, Export Credit Insurance is a valuable tool. If an insurer is unwilling to provide coverage for a particular buyer, that buyer is most likely considered to be high risk. In this case, the US exporter should probably insist on receiving a Confirmed LC or Cash In Advance.</p>

<p><strong>Looking at some examples.</strong></p>

<p>On the next page we show examples of how both the Catastrophic and No or Low Deductible Programs might actually work. It bears repeating that we advise US Exporters to consult a specialist Credit Insurance broker before proceeding further.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Export Credit Insurance Programs</strong></p>

<p>The following two diagrams highlight the two main types of programs available to US exporters, a <strong>No or Low Deductible Program</strong> and a <strong>High or Catastrophic Deductible Program</strong>. The No Deductible Program is more expensive as it pays claims regardless of loss size. Two payment default scenarios are listed after each program type and show how much indemnity the insured US exporter would receive in the event of a $600,000 default and a $100,000 default. These programs are representative only and actual premium and deductible levels will depend on the US exporter and their insured buyers.</p>
