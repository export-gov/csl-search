        <p>Market growth in recent years reflects the rising crime rate in Argentina. Acts of violence, including street crime, bank robberies, and private property theft, have been on the rise. While Argentina’s crime rate is lower than in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, or Venezuela, crime is an issue that has been emphasized in the press. The widespread perception of growing insecurity, along with the increasing priority of improving workplace security, has contributed to the growth of the electronic security sector in Argentina, which grew 31 percent in 2012.</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, a trend has been to import parts for fire and safety equipment. Although there has been an increase of local assembly of alarms, detectors, and electronic fire systems to offer significantly lower prices and to take advantage of the “Buy Argentina” law and tax benefits, high-tech imports will continue to play a significant role in the overall security market, since domestic manufacturers tend to satisfy the demand for less sophisticated equipment.</p>

<p>Argentina continues to present many opportunities to U.S. exporters. However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).</p>
