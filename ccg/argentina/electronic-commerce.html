        <p>The number of people with Internet access continued to grow in 2012, although at a moderate 2 percent rate. Network expansion allows people to connect from multiple locations such as offices, cyber-cafes, phone booths, etc. Over 25 million people (over half the Argentine population) were Internet users in 2011. E-commerce activity has grown tenfold since 2000 in peso terms.</p>

<p>The Argentine Government plans to call public tenders to lay 13,500 km (8,388 mi.) of cable in 2013 as part of the country's federal fiber network project “<em>Argentina Conectada</em>”. This will add to the already-installed 8,000 km (4,971 mi.) of fiber. Once the national fiber platform is fully deployed, more than 1,400 cities and localities across Argentina will have connectivity. To date, the GOA has invested more than $484 million.</p>

<p>While sales via Internet have not traditionally reached the same levels as in other countries, a study conducted by Prince &amp; Cook showed an increase of approximately 50 percent in 2011. Online purchases using credit cards represented 68.3 percent of total online transactions, up from 30 percent in 2009. This may be due to the boom experienced by discount coupon sales and a growing confidence in electronic payment sites. Online sales have also a high rate of acceptance in the interior of the country, where the variety of products available is more limited and delivery is an increasingly important sales tool.</p>
