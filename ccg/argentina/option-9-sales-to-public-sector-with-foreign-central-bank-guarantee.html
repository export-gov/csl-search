<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>When federal, state and municipal entities in Latin American purchase goods abroad, Central Banks of the purchasing country will frequently issue a guarantee to the foreign exporter. Many US firms currently accept Central Bank guarantees and sell on what can essentially be considered to be open account terms secured by the Central Bank guarantee.</p>

<p>For larger ticket items, many US exporters seek a bank to prepay all or part of the purchase price. As a result a financial institution, either US or Latin American-based, may finance the transaction.</p>

<p>Some US Banks may seek sovereign guarantee insurance from a US insurer in order to gain additional transaction security, particularly for extremely large transactions.</p>
