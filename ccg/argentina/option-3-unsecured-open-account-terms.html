<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A US exporter agrees to ship goods to the Latin American buyer prior to receiving payment. The purchase order or sales contract indicates at what point in the future the Latin American buyer is obliged to pay the US exporter. Normally the Latin American buyer will transfer the funds to the US exporter at a certain point in the future. Generally open account terms are short-term and rarely exceed 120 days. It should be noted that 30, 60 and 90 days are most common in Latin America.</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Selling on Unsecured Open Account terms is highly risky for US exporters and is generally not recommended without the added security of Export Credit Insurance. US exporters should only consider providing Unsecured Open Account terms to Latin American buyers for:</p>

<p>• Firms that are very creditworthy;</p>

<p>• Firms that US exporters have had a great deal of favorable experience with.</p>
