        <p><strong>ALADI</strong></p>

<p>Argentina is a founding member of the Association for Latin American Integration (ALADI), which was created with the long-term goal of establishing a Latin American Common Market. Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are also founding members; Cuba attained full membership in 1999. Under the ALADI, member countries sign regional and bilateral agreements that allow partial trade liberalization that can then be extended to other members. In the 25 years since its creation, Argentina has signed several regional, multilateral and bilateral arrangements. The Internet address for ALADI is: <a href="http://www.aladi.org/nsfweb/sitioIng/">http://www.aladi.org/nsfweb/sitioIng/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MERCOSUR</strong></p>

<p>Argentina is a member of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), which entered into force in January 1991. MERCOSUR members originally included Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela joined the pact as associate members. By 1995, about 75 percent of tariff categories were included in the Common External Tariff (CET) and the remaining categories will be phased-in by 2015. MERCOSUR represents 70 percent of the South American territory and 64 percent of its population. The Internet address is as follows: <a href="http://www.mercosur.int/">http://www.mercosur.int/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MERCOSUR negotiations with other economic blocs and countries:</strong></p>

<p>MERCOSUR-European Union</p>

<p>The two blocs had made the commitment of reaching an agreement on the process of integration by October 2004, but several differences between the blocs impeded final negotiations. These are broad and include goods, services, investments, government procurement, and intellectual property rights, among other issues.</p>

<p>MERCOSUR-Andean Community of Nations</p>

<p>(Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela)</p>

<p>The agreement took place in October 2004 and contemplates the liberalization of 80 percent of trade between the blocs within the next ten years, beginning in 2005.</p>

<p><em>MERCOSUR-Venezuela</em></p>

<p>In July 2006, MERCOSUR members accepted Venezuela’s request to become a MERCOSUR full member, which it did during 2012. Venezuela must adapt to MERCOSUR Common External Tariff scheme within a four-year timeframe, and will gradually lose its benefits from being part of the Andean Community of Nations.
MERCOSUR-Mexico</p>

<p>In July 2004, Mexico was accepted by MERCOSUR as an “observer country” within the bloc, with a view to its inclusion as associate member.</p>
