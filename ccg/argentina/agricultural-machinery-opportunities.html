        <p>Products offering cost savings on the use of seed, fertilizer and agrochemicals are most in demand, especially those which incorporate a high level of nutrients in order to maintain yields and improve the quality of the products: information technology services for agriculture via wireless connections and Wi-Max networks; seeder pumps; GPS; data collection equipment for soil analysis, crop yields, remote sensing applications; and sprayer nozzles. Please note that used and remanufactured/reconditioned machinery and parts cannot be imported to Argentina.</p>

<p>However, recent controls imposed by the Argentine government have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult. It is important for would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customer has received all the necessary permits (see “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).</p>
