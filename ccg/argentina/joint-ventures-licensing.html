        <p>Argentine legislation permits the establishment of temporary associations, equivalent to joint ventures, known as UTEs (<em>Unión Transitoria de Empresas</em>). This is an association of two or more individuals or companies that contribute assets to develop or perform a particular transaction in Argentina or outside the country using Argentina as its base of operations. UTEs are not considered companies or legal entities in their own right. Participants may be resident businesspeople, locally constituted entities, or non-resident companies that have established a separate branch or other type of Argentine presence.</p>

<p>A contract must be signed and registered with the Public Commercial Registry at the Office of the Inspector General of Justice (<em>Inspección General de Justicia</em>) in the Federal Capital, or its provincial equivalent. The contract must contain the objective, duration, name and other specific information regarding the partners' responsibilities, financial contribution, and many other specific clauses. It must also provide for the appointment of a legal representative in charge of management.</p>
