        <p>Law 25551, issued on November 2001 and implemented by Decree 1600/2002, established the “Buy Argentine” Regime. The "<em>Compre Trabajo Argentino</em>" regime obligates all government agencies, public and privatized utilities, and concessionaires to purchase domestic materials, goods and products, provided that the price is "reasonable" (<em>precio razonable</em>) and the performance is identical or similar (<em>idénticas o similares prestaciones</em>) to that of the imported/foreign goods offered, as defined by regulatory Decree 1600/2002 of August 28, 2002. In March 2011, the Argentine Senate approved an amendment to Law 25551, extending the entities subject to the “Buy Argentine” regime. The draft law is still pending in the Argentine Lower House Committees.</p>
