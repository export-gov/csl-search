        <p>Financial transactions are generally made in pesos (legal tender), U.S. dollars, and Government securities. The three segments that make up Argentina's financial system are: peso, foreign currency, and the liquid assets under management of all banks in the financial system.</p>

<p>The main transactions are:</p>

<p>• Overdraft</p>

<p>• Promissory notes</p>

<p>• Discount of bills</p>

<p>• Mortgage loans</p>

<p>• Collateral loans</p>

<p>• Consumer loans</p>

<p>• Credit cards</p>

<p>• Demand deposits</p>

<p>• Certificates of deposit</p>

<p>• Common savings deposits</p>

<p>• Deposits in Argentine-government securities</p>

<p>• Interbank transactions</p>

<p>• Swaps</p>

<p>• Bankers acceptances</p>

<p>• Spot exchange transactions</p>

<p>• Forward exchange transactions</p>

<p>In the late nineties, 120 banks operated in Argentina, but after the shake out from the 2002-2003 peso devaluation crisis there are approximately 65 today. However, the financial system is perceived to be healthier than it was during the 90s. Some public banks have improved management quality and, as a result, benefited from a significant increase in deposits over the last few years. Most financial institutions in Argentina continue to expand operations in key niches favoring greater financial margins. Banks currently enjoy higher-quality client-portfolios than in the pre-crisis scenario.</p>
