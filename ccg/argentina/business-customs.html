        <p>U.S. businesspeople should take the time to develop a close personal relationship with their agent, representative, distributor, or other business partner. Argentine business customs are generally more formal than those in the United States. Business dress, appearance, and general demeanor are more conservative.</p>

<p>Courtesy is very important, and efforts to rush a business deal are likely to be unsuccessful. No encounter starts with a business discussion. To develop a solid business relationship and establish trust it is important to devote some time to discussing family members, sports, and social activities. At meetings it is important to shake hands with everyone in the room upon arrival and departure. Among Argentines it is customary for men to kiss women they meet for the first time on the right cheek. However, Americans should shake hands with Argentine women until a friendly relationship has been established.</p>

<p>Contacts and introductions are important and therefore, it is advisable to use the services of the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires, or other organizations such as the American Chamber of Commerce, industry associations, and other intermediaries, rather than rely on a direct "cold call" approach. The U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina offers a complete package for the businessperson to meet with potential business partners.</p>

<p>It is important that you arrive promptly to business meetings, though your Argentine contact may be slightly late, and to always have a pre-arranged appointment. Be sure to have an ample supply of business cards. Although not essential, it is beneficial to have cards printed in Spanish as well as English.</p>

<p>One cultural note is that it is not good form to say you are from "America." In Latin America, the term "America" denotes both North and South America, not just the United States. Therefore, it is better to call yourself a “North American” (<em>norteamericano</em>).</p>
