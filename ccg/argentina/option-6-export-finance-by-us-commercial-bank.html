        <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>The basics of Export Finance are very simple. In essence, a bank pays a US exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a Latin American buyer. Beyond the basics however, there are two main variations of Export Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Variation 1: Supplier vs. Buyer Credit: Who is responsible for repaying the loan?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first variation depends on who, contractually, is assuming the responsibility for repaying the loan.</strong> Is it the US Exporter or is it the Foreign Buyer? If the Exporter is responsible for repaying the loan it is called <strong>Supplier Credit</strong>. If the Buyer is responsible for repaying the loan, it is called <strong>Buyer Credit</strong>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Supplier Credit is far riskier for the US Exporter than Buyer Credit due to the fact that under the terms of Supplier Credit, even if the foreign buyer fails to pay the US Exporter the US Exporter is still contractually obliged to repay the lending bank the full loan amount.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize that when US exporters sell to foreign buyers, including Latin America, it is rare that banks will approve Credit (either Supplier or Buyer) without a guarantee from either Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or another Export Credit Insurer). Accordingly, the following two types of Export Finance are uncommon but do exist in cases in which the US Exporter is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Supplier Credit) or in which the Foreign Buyer is well known and extremely strong financially (in the case of Buyer Credit).</p>

<p>The general process of arranging Supplier Credit is as follows:</p>

<p>1.)  Bank in US works with the US exporter and buyer to arrange financing.</p>

<p>2.)  Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the US exporter.</p>

<p>3.) The US bank discounts the promissory note issued by the foreign buyer which is made payable to the US exporter.</p>

<p>The general process of arranging Buyer Credit is as follows:</p>

<p>1.)  Bank located in US works with the buyer and exporter to arrange financing.</p>

<p>2.) Loan documentation is arranged and signed between the US bank and the foreign buyer. Financing terms and conditions are based on the buyer’s credit worthiness.</p>

<p>3.)  The US bank pays the US exporter on behalf of the foreign buyer.</p>

<p><strong>Variation 2: With or Without Credit Guarantee - Is a credit guarantee used by the lending institution?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The second main variation of Export Finance is whether or not a credit guarantee is used by the lending bank to provide it with security against the risk of non-payment</strong> by either the US Exporter (in the case of Supplier Credit) or the Foreign Buyer (in the case of Buyer Credit). Credit Guarantees are frequently provided to US Banks by U.S. Ex-Im Bank or other credit insurers, as outlined in the section on Export Credit Insurance.</p>

<p>The following four diagrams highlight both simple Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit without an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee and Supplier Credit and Buyer Credit with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Due to the fact that loan costs increase when the lending bank uses a Guarantee the total loan cost increases accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Comments / Additional Information:</strong></p>

<p>In general export financings of sales to buyers in most Latin American countries contain a 6-month grace period after which the buyer/supplier must begin repaying the bank.</p>

<p>The costs (premium) associated with a US Ex-Im Bank Guarantee (or that of another credit insurer) range from approximately 1.5% and 2% per year in addition to the cost of funding from the commercial bank. Premium can fluctuate dramatically based on the perceived risk of a given buyer. In other words, the weaker the borrower, the more expensive the premium.</p>

<p>Due to the added complexity and additional work required to arrange the transaction, the finance cost generally increases more than the simple cost of the Ex-Im Bank Guarantee. Banks interviewed indicated that Export Finance for US exports to Latin America with an Ex-Im Bank Guarantee generally cost as follows and depends on the amount financed:</p>

<p>Ex-Im Bank Credit Benchmarks:</p>

<p>Foreign buyers must meet a number of minimum credit benchmarks in order to be approved for an Ex-Im Bank loan guarantee (please see <a href="http://www.exim.gov/">www.exim.gov</a>). The following are among the key credit standards that generally must be met:</p>

<p>• Positive Operating Profit over last 2 years.</p>

<p>• Positive Net Income over last 2 years.</p>

<p>• Positive Cash Flow From Operations (latest year).</p>

<p>• EBITDA / Debt Service greater than 150%.</p>

<p>• Total Liabilities/Total Net Worth less than 175%.</p>

<p>• Ex-Im Bank Exposure/Total Net Worth less than 40%.</p>
