        <p>Although it is theoretically possible to arrange a work permit following arrival in Argentina, the process is much more complicated and time-consuming than applying for the work visa abroad, and one may not legally begin remunerated employment until permission has been granted. Therefore, it is important to begin the work visa process as early as possible by applying at an Argentine consular office in the United States or abroad. This process can still be quite lengthy and require many civil documents (e.g., birth and marriage certificates) and police certificates. U.S. civil documents submitted to Argentine consular offices do not require Argentine consular certification. The government of Argentina requires only a Hague Convention apostille certificate from the Secretary of State of the U.S. state where the document was issued or from the U.S. Department of State for U.S. federal government-issued documents.</p>

<p>Argentine immigration law provides for the following temporary and permanent resident categories and conditions:</p>

<p>• <em>Transitory residents, tourists, and students</em> are not allowed to carry on a remunerated or profitable activity unless expressly authorized by the immigration authorities.</p>

<p>• <em>Temporary residents</em> may perform such activities during their authorized stay if they obtain a work permit. The work permit can be obtained from the immigration authorities at the Immigration Office after filing relevant documentation. The permit authorizes a stay from one to three years.</p>

<p>• <em>Permanent residents</em> may perform any type of remunerated or profitable activity, either as employees or self-employed.</p>

<p>There are special immigration provisions for some foreign professional, scientific, or technical research personnel hired abroad to render services in Argentina for a maximum of two years. They must not be residents in Argentina and must be covered for contingencies such as old age, disability, or death by the law of their own country.</p>
