        <p>U.S. carriers flying to Argentina include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. The primary gateways are Dallas, Houston, Miami, New York, and Atlanta. The Argentine carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas, also flies between the U.S. and Argentina. In-country travel, and travel between Argentina and other South American countries, is widely available from a variety of Argentine and foreign carriers. Two main airports serve Buenos Aires; Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, which is located near downtown serving domestic flights and some regional flights to Uruguay and Paraguay, and Ezeiza International Airport, which is a 45-minute drive from Buenos Aires, serving all other international flights, including those from the U.S.</p>

<p>Taxis are plentiful and are generally the most effective way of moving around Buenos Aires. A widely available private car service, called "<em>remise</em>", is also available and is the recommended method of travel from Ezeiza International Airport into Buenos Aires. <em>Remise</em> services have counters at the airport. For security reasons, the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires recommends that travelers use either <em>remises</em> or radio taxis, rather than hailing taxis on the street.</p>

<p>Travel in Argentina can be accomplished by train, bus, or car, although air travel is recommended for many trips to key cities in the provinces due to large distances. Automobile rental is available throughout the country, although it is quite expensive compared to U.S. rental costs. Travelers should be aware that Argentina has a high rate of auto accidents, and driving is not recommended for short visits.</p>
