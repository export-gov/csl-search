        <p>The population and economic activity are highly concentrated in the Greater Buenos Aires area. The population is of largely European descent and continues to have strong ethnic, cultural, and business ties with Europe. In some respects, consumer preferences resemble those of Europeans more than those of other Latin American nationals.</p>

<p>The U.S. continues to be one of Argentina's top trading partners. Many U.S. firms have been very successful here and U.S. products have a strong reputation for quality and technological innovation. The U.S. lifestyle and consumption habits are increasingly influential.</p>

<p>As in many countries, personal relationships are fundamental when doing business in Argentina. Success requires taking the time to develop a close personal relationship with the representative, agent, or distributor. Marketing U.S. products and services in Argentina requires a higher level of research, preparation, and involvement.</p>

<p>Always use a professional translator, and if possible, have a native Argentine speaker, such as your agent or distributor, review any materials before using them in Argentina. Any official document to be presented before GOA authorities that is not in Spanish requires attachment of an official translation into Spanish by a Sworn Public Translator (<em>Traductor Público</em>), as well as certification by the Translators Association.</p>

<p>Price and financing terms have become increasingly important selling factors.</p>

<p>Some practical tips to successfully approach Argentine consumers are the following:</p>

<p>• Appoint a representative or distributor</p>

<p>• Have Spanish language capacity</p>

<p>• Furnish materials in Spanish</p>

<p>• Have a long-term outlook</p>

<p>• Personalize your approach</p>

<p>• Be consistent in attention to service and delivery</p>

<p>• Provide credit terms</p>

<p>• Dot your I's and cross your T's (i.e., consult as appropriate with lawyers and accountants)</p>

<p>• Protect your trademarks</p>

<p>• Engage in frequent visits and follow-ups</p>
