        <p>E-commerce is increasingly a part of daily life, particularly given a higher penetration of home broadband connections. Traditionally, companies that sell cosmetics, kitchenware, fragrances, and books have been most likely to utilize direct marketing tools. However, the increasing use of the Internet is enabling other firms/sectors to penetrate the market. Companies selling household consumer goods, electronic devices, merchandising, books and CDs, computer hardware, tourism services, and cars publish their product catalogs on-line.</p>

<p>Some imported products are marketed directly through cable and satellite TV programs. Mail-order marketing is still not as widespread in Argentina. Mail distribution prices remain high, while duties and other taxes to be paid on international mail order merchandise depend on the nature of the product or mode of shipment. In addition, there are restrictions on imports of printed material.</p>
