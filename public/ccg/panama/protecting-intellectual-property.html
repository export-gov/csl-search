        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Several general principles are important for effective management of intellectual property rights in Panama. First, it is important to have an overall strategy to protect IPR. Second, IPR is protected differently in Panama than in the U.S. Third, rights must be registered and enforced in Panama under local laws. Companies may wish to seek advice from local attorneys or IP consultants. Please contact us at <a href="daniel.crocker@trade.gov">Daniel.Crocker@trade.gov</a> for a list of qualified attorneys in Panama.</p>

<p>It is vital that companies understand that intellectual property is primarily a private right and that the U.S. Embassy generally cannot enforce rights for private companies in Panama. It is the responsibility of the rights' holders to register, protect, and enforce their rights where relevant, retaining their own counsel and advisors. While we are willing to assist you, there is little we can do if the rights holders have not taken these fundamental steps necessary to securing and enforcing their IPR in a timely fashion. Moreover, in many countries, rights holders who delay enforcing their rights in the mistaken belief that the US Embassy can provide a political resolution to a legal problem may find that their rights have been eroded or abrogated due to doctrines such as statutes of limitation or unreasonable delay in prosecuting a law suit. In no instance should our advice be seen as a substitute for the obligation of a rights holder to promptly pursue his case.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on partners. We recommend conducting more due diligence than would be normal for the U.S. A good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Keep an eye on your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentives) of would-be bad actors. Projects and sales in Panama require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Panama laws to create a solid contract that includes non-compete clauses, and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions. In certain instances we can assist you with conducting due diligence by conducting a background check through our Business Facilitation Service. For more information on this service, please <a href="daniel.crocker@trade.gov">contact us.</a></p>

<p>We also recommend that small and medium-size companies understand the importance of working with trade associations and organizations to support efforts to protect IPR and stop counterfeiting. There are a number of these organizations, both in Panama and the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>IPR Climate in Panama</strong></p>

<p>Panama has an adequate and effective domestic legal framework to protect and enforce intellectual property. Intellectual property policy and practice in Panama is the responsibility of an inter-institutional Committee for Intellectual Property (CIPI), which includes representatives from five government agencies (Colon Free Zone, Offices of Intellectual Property Registry and Copyright under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Customs, and the Attorney General) under the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MICI). Individuals can search their website, <a href="www.digerpi.gob.pa">http://www.digerpi.gob.pa,</a> for information in Spanish about trademarks, patents, plant varieties, collective rights, and various legal documents.</p>

<p>Laws 15 (1994) and 35 (1996) as amended are the basis for Panama’s intellectual property regime. Law 1 (2004) added crimes against intellectual property as a predicate offense for money laundering; Law 14 (2007) establishes a five to 12 year prison sentence, plus possible fines. Law 10 (2011) moved the Copyright Office from the Ministry of Education to MICI. In 1997, the Customs Directorate created a special office for IPR enforcement, followed by a similar office created by the Colon Free Zone in 1998. Since June 1997, two district courts and one superior tribunal have been exclusively adjudicating anti-trust, patent, trademark, and copyright cases. Beginning in January 2003, there has been an IPR-specific prosecutor with national authority, which has consolidated and simplified prosecution of those cases.</p>

<p>However, Panama ranked 133 out of 142 by the 2011 World Economic Forum in judicial independence (not just on intellectual property issues), and the Embassy is aware of complaints by U.S. companies about judicial irregularities and corruption relating to intellectual property cases, and has raised the issue with relevant government authorities. Given Panama’s role as a transshipment point and limited resources dedicated to addressing IPR (and other) issue, U.S. industry remains concerned that the Colon Free Zone is a conduit for trading in pirated and counterfeit goods.</p>

<p>Mortgages, liens, and other security interests are recognized and registered in the public registry. Much of the information contained in the public registry is available on-line. The public property registry has been expanded and modernized. Unique features of Panamanian law and practice in specific areas (including but not limited to banking, accounting requirements, formation and functioning of corporations, and taxation) make retention of local legal counsel highly advisable.</p>

<p>Panama is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the Geneva Phonograms Convention, the Brussels Satellite Convention, the Universal Copyright Convention, the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the International Convention for the Protection of Plant Varieties. In addition, Panama was one of the first countries to ratify the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, although the GOP has yet to introduce implementing legislation to put these treaties fully into force in Panama and to establish new offenses, such as those needed for internet-based copyright violations and to enhance border measures.</p>

<p>On June 28, 2007, the United States and Panama signed the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA). Panama approved the TPA on July 11, 2007. The US Congress approved implementing legislation on October 12, 2011, and President Obama signed it on October 21, 2011. Presidents Obama and Martinelli have agreed to implement the TPA as quickly as possible, but no date has been set for it to enter into force. The TPA provides for improved standards for the protection and enforcement of a broad range of intellectual property rights, which are consistent with U.S. standards of protection and enforcement and with emerging international standards. Such improvements would provide for improved standards for the protection and enforcement of a broad range of IPR, including protections for patents, trademarks, undisclosed test and other data submitted to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, and digital copyrighted products such as software, music, text, and videos. Under the TPA, Panama would be obligated to ratify or accede to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Convention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite, and the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure by the date the TPA enters into force. Panama would also be obligated to ratify or accede to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants and the Trademark Law Treaty. The TPA confirms that the obligations do not and should not prevent the United States or Panama from taking measures to protect public health, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, by promoting access to medicines for all. The TPA also obligates Panama to enforce intellectual property rights in administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings, and at the border.</p>

<p><strong>Copyrights</strong></p>

<p>The National Assembly in 1994 passed a comprehensive copyright bill (Law 15), based on a World Intellectual Property Organization model. Law 15 provides copyright protection based on the life of the author plus 50 years. If there are co-authors, the protection is until 50 years after the death of the last author. Collective works, software and audiovisual works are also covered for 50 years since the date of publication or after the work is finished (with no publication). The law modernizes copyright protection in Panama, provides for payment of royalties, facilitates the prosecution of copyright violators, protects computer software, and makes copyright infringement a felony. Though Panama’s 1994 copyright law modernized copyright protection and amendments to the law in 2004 provided for a special Copyright Office with anti-piracy enforcement powers, piracy remains a problem. Films in theatrical release are often downloaded to DVDs and videos, reproduced on optical discs, and then distributed by street vendors.</p>

<p>The TPA requires implementation of the WIPO Treaties in a manner consistent with the U.S. digital Millennium Copyright Act. The TPA would also extend copyright protection to life of the author plus 70 years; would require both governments to mandate the use of legal software in government agencies; and would include provisions to protect against the theft of encrypted satellite signals and the manufacturing or sale of tools to steal such signals.</p>

<p><strong>Patents</strong></p>

<p>Panama is a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. Panama’s Industrial Property Law (Law 35 of 1996) provides a term of 20 years of patent protection from the date of filing. Law 35 provides specific protection for trade secrets.</p>

<p>Under the TPA, Panama would make patents available for any invention, subject to limited exclusions. Additionally, Panama commits to make best efforts to process patent applications and marketing approval applications expeditiously. With respect to most products, Panama must provide adjustments to the patent term to compensate for unreasonable delays that occur while granting a patent. For pharmaceutical products, Panama may, but is not required to, adjust the patent term if there is an unreasonable delay in granting a patent or providing marketing approval for a product. In addition, Panama commits to protect for specific periods of time test data and other information that pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical companies submit to government regulators in order to secure regulatory approval for their patented products. When relying on the previous approval of a pharmaceutical product in the United States, and upon meeting certain other conditions for expeditious approval, the period of protection for test and other data in Panama will be counted from the date of approval of that product in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Trademarks</strong></p>

<p>Panama’s legal system provides for a trademark protection regime, which includes a simplified process of trademark registration, and the ability to renew a trademark for 10-year periods. However, U.S. companies report judicial irregularities and corruption once the cases reach the courts. In one case, a U.S. multinational’s brand was illegally copied and the Colon Free Zone-based distributor of the IPR-infringing goods has continued to sell the knock-offs pending resolution of the case in the courts.</p>

<p>Law 35 provides trademark protection, simplifies the process of registering trademarks and allows for renewal of a trademark for ten-year periods. An important feature of the law is the granting of ex-officio authority to government agencies to conduct investigations and to seize materials suspected of being counterfeited. Decrees 123 of November 1996 and 79 of August 1997 specify the procedures to be followed by Customs and Colon Free Zone (CFZ) officials in conducting investigations and confiscating merchandise. In 1997, the Customs Directorate created a special office for IPR enforcement, followed by a similar office created by the CFZ in 1998. The <a href="http://www.digerpi.gob.pa./">Trademark Registration Office</a> has undertaken significant modernization with a searchable computerized database of registered trademarks that is open to the public as well as online registration.</p>

<p>The Trademark Registration Office’s website allows applicants to track the status of their Trademark and Patent applications and creates a Customer Service Center. The Trademark Registration Office claims to be the most advanced in the region, with 90% automation. This office reports that it has reduced trademark registration processing time in half, down from one year to six months. This office also reports that it has conducted classes on the importance of IPR protection at the Technical University of Panama and recently sponsored a National Inventor's Competition that brought inventors together with prospective investors and customers.</p>

<p>Under the TPA, Panama must protect trademarks and geographical indications, including by refusing protection or recognition of a geographical indication that is likely to be confusingly similar to a preexisting trademark. Panama must also have a system of registration that provides efficient and transparent procedures governing applications to protect trademarks and geographical indications.</p>
