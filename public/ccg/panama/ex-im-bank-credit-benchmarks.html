<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>A Latin American bank pays a US exporter in advance for goods to be shipped to a Latin American buyer. The Latin American bank is essentially providing the Latin American buyer a loan and the Latin American buyer will have to repay the bank as contractually agreed in the financing agreement between the bank and the buyer. In Latin America, these financings generally have a 6-month grace period after which the buyer must begin repaying the Bank.</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Although this option is extremely expensive for Latin American buyers it is frequently the only alternative available to them, particularly when they are purchasing larger ticket capital equipment items.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Latin American companies can arrange at-market or even below-market direct loans with certain Development Banks. In many cases, the funds can be used to purchase goods from US Exporters.</p>

<p><img src="../images/linescreditterms.png" alt="LinesCreditTerms" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of development banks in Latin America. Many countries have both federally supported and state-level supported development banks. The attractiveness of these loans varies from country to country, so we recommend contacting us at <a href="www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas">www.buyusa.gov/tradeamericas/ </a>for more information on a particular development bank.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>When federal, state and municipal entities in Latin American purchase goods abroad, Central Banks of the purchasing country will frequently issue a guarantee to the foreign exporter. Many US firms currently accept Central Bank guarantees and sell on what can essentially be considered to be open account terms secured by the Central Bank guarantee.</p>

<p>For larger ticket items, many US exporters seek a bank to prepay all or part of the purchase price. As a result a financial institution, either US or Latin American-based, may finance the transaction.</p>

<p>Some US Banks may seek sovereign guarantee insurance from a US insurer in order to gain additional transaction security, particularly for extremely large transactions.</p>

<p><img src="../images/centralbankterms.png" alt="CentralBankTerms" /></p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

<p>Central Bank guarantees are excellent tools that enable foreign public sector buyers to obtain credit and/or lower cost financing.</p>

<p>There are 3 basic variations of the simple Central Bank Guarantee, shown in increasing complexity.</p>
