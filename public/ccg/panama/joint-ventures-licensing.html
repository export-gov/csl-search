        <p>Joint ventures, especially for large projects, are becoming common in Panama. Some joint ventures are formed for limited periods of time, such as for a specific construction contract or technology transfer contract. The profits from joint ventures can be distributed annually to each joint venture partner and are taxed in the same manner as any other income.</p>

<p>Panamanian law requires the registration of license agreements, although in practice few licensors and licensees do so. License agreements are frequently used to reinforce rights to registered trademarks. The agreements must be attached to the registered trademark and filed with the Industrial Property Department in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The agreement becomes part of the file on the trademark covered.</p>

<p>Panama is an interesting and potentially profitable site for licensing agreements and joint ventures as well as routine buy/sell operations. The Colon Free Zone (CFZ) offers the U.S. exporter looking for regional marketing arrangements a convenient one-stop distribution center. However, there have been instances of money laundering, intellectual property piracy and drug trafficking reported in the CFZ. All U.S. firms should perform due diligence before commencing operations there. Please <a href="http://export.gov/panama/contactus/index.asp">contact us</a> for assistance in identifying good business partners in the CFZ.</p>
