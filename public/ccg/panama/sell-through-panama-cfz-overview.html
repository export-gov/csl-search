        <p>The Colon Free Trade Zone (CFZ) offers a remarkable opportunity to U.S. companies in the consumer retail sector. It is currently the world’s second largest free trade zone – trailing Hong Kong – but is much more accessible for merchants from throughout Latin America. In the CFZ, a U.S. exporter can sell to one merchant, duty free, and then expect to see his products distributed and retailed throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean region of South America as a result.</p>

<p>The ideal U.S. company for this sort of model is one that is making a consumer retail item in the U.S. that already enjoys strong domestic sales to such mass merchants as Walgreen’s, Target, or Wal-Mart. However, the CFZ also enjoys strong sales in all areas of consumer retail, such as sporting goods, jewelry, perfumes, electronics, and clothing at all price points. So if you were to imagine any consumer good, from a lower end item at a Wal-Mart to a higher end luxury item at a Neiman Marcus, you would probably be able to find it for sale in the CFZ.</p>
