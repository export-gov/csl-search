        <p>U.S. citizens may enter Panama with a valid passport (min. 6 months) and a return airline ticket, and are automatically authorized to stay in the country for 180 days as tourist. The 180 day period is nonrenewable. An old tourist card requirement was eliminated. There are three types of visas available to businesspersons wishing to spend extended periods of time in Panama:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inversionista (Investor):</strong> A minimum of US$ 160,000 must be invested in setting up a company in Panama with a minimum of five Panamanian employees in its payroll, and US$ 1,050 must be deposited in advance (US$ 800 with the National Immigration Service and US$ 250 with the National Treasury).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permiso Temporal (Temporary Permit):</strong> For executives transferred from an overseas office to work in Panama temporarily or technicians working with a company in Panama for a limited time. Executives must prove their income will come from outside of Panama. Foreign technicians shall not exceed 15% of the employees of the company. The visa is valid for one year and is renewable up for six years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visa Corta Estancia Por Negocios (Short Stay Business Visa):</strong> For businesspersons coming to Panama for the purpose of setting up a branch office of a foreign company in Panama. The visa is valid for up to nine months and is nonrenewable.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are other business related residency permits available, some related to special zones such as the “Panama – Pacific Area”; the “City of Knowledge”; “Export Processing Zones”; and for “Call Centers.”</p>

<p>There is a US$ 40 departure tax on leaving the country. This is usually charged in the airline ticket.</p>

<p>U.S. Citizens are subject to Panamanian law when visiting Panama and penalties for possession, use and trafficking in illegal drugs are severe.</p>

<p>If you plan to bring representatives or technicians to the U.S. for training, you should be aware that Panamanian nationals need a valid visa. Visa applicants should go to the following link: <a href="http://panama.usembassy.gov/non-immigrant.html">http://panama.usembassy.gov/non-immigrant.html</a>.</p>

<p>U.S. Companies that require travel of foreign businesspersons from Panama to the United States should be advised that visa issuance is managed by the U.S. Department of State’s Consular Section rather than the U.S. Department of Commerce. Visa applicants should go to the following links:</p>
