        <p>Panama has excellent air transportation facilities. Three major U.S. airlines serve the country, as well as others from different countries. COPA, the Panamanian airline, has a regional hub at the Tocumen International Airport, connecting Panama with major cities in the U.S. and Latin America.</p>

<p>Buses and taxis are readily available in urban areas. Taxi fares are low and usually range from US$ 2-10 depending on the trip's length. Congestion in the Panama City metro area is a rapidly increasing problem, but since the metro area is relatively compact, taxi service is the best way to get around.</p>

<p>The Government of Panama is executing a plan for a fully integrated bus and metro transit system to deal with the congestion.</p>

<p>Transportation from Tocumen International Airport into Panama City can be made by a special taxi service, with prices between US$ 30 - $35 depending on the size of the taxis. Taxis may be shared with other passengers. Car rentals are available. There is no bus service at the airport.</p>

<p>Major car rental companies operate in Panama and offer excellent services.</p>

<p>There is train service from Panama City to Colon, on the Atlantic side, operated by Kansas City Southern. This is primarily a container transportation facility but the railroad also operates limited passenger service. It has become an attractive tourism option to visit Colon.</p>
