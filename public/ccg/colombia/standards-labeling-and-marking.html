        <p>Specific marks or labels are not required for products, except for food, pharmaceutical, and textiles products. Labels on processed food products must indicate: the specific name of the product, ingredients in order of predominance, name and address of manufacturer and importer, number of units, instructions for storage and usage (when required), expiration date, and other instructions as required by the Ministry of Social Protection or the Industry and Commerce Superintendent. Labels and illustrations cannot be inaccurate or misleading. Labels on pharmaceutical products must indicate in Spanish: "for sale under medical, dental, or veterinary prescription,‚Äù with the generic name, commercial name, net weight or volume, weight or quantity of active ingredients, license number, and the lot control number. For those products having limited shelf life, labels should include the date of expiration. Insecticides and other toxic products should display the skull and crossbones, the word "poison" in Spanish, and information regarding usage and antidotes. Products for which there are no antidotes cannot be licensed and can only be used in programs under the direct control of public health authorities.</p>

<p>The SIC oversees compliance with labeling and marking requirements of all products (imported or produced locally), including displaying the unit of measure using the international system of measurements. ICONTEC has developed several Colombian technical standards on labeling and marking requirements for different products.</p>

<p>The National Metrology Institute (INM), created by Decree 4175 of November 2011, provides calibration of metrology systems, provides technical training and coordinates activities with the International Legal Metrology Organization (OIML). The INM took the metrology responsibilities from SIC, and controls the national standard for the main physical properties (weight, volume, temperature, etc.) that serves as reference to the Colombian industry.</p>
