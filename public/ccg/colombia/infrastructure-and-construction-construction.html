        <p>Market research firm Business Monitor International (BMI) has recently revised their forecast for the construction industry’s real growth in Colombia from 5.5 percent to 8.35 percent for 2013. This is underpinned by an official revision to industry growth in 2012, which was previously believed to have been 3.28 percent, but is now reported by Colombia's Central Bank to have been 6.3 percent. In addition, the industry reported strong growth of 9.89 percent in the first half of 2013. With continued strong backing from the GOC for the sector, BMI maintains their outlook of a healthy annual average real construction growth of 5.9 percent between 2014 and 2018.</p>

<p>The GOC's Development Plan 2011-2014 has five sectors called "government engines of growth" among which the most representative are Housing (construction goal of US$1 million affordable houses for the underprivileged) and Infrastructure (construction and</p>

<p>60 remodeling airports, ports, roads, etc.), which are expected to generate a growing demand for building materials of low, medium and high range.</p>

<p>Standards are becoming a differentiator for Colombian buyers seeking quality and value. In general, Colombian consumers appreciate U.S. products due to their excellent quality. However, competitive prices are also a decisive factor when competing in this market. In this sense, it is important to highlight the significant growth of Chinese imports during recent years, with approximately 40 percent market share due to considerably low prices.</p>

<p>The FTA, which entered into force in May 2012, is expected to result in a measurable increase in U.S. exports of building products to Colombia. Tariffs on building products in Colombia before the FTA averaged 13.2 percent, ranging from zero to 20 percent. Since May 2012 over 42 percent of U.S. building products exports to Colombia enter the country duty-free. Tariffs on an additional 8 percent are scheduled to be eliminated over five years and tariffs on a further 2 percent of exports are scheduled to be eliminated over seven years. Tariffs on the remaining 48 percent of building products are scheduled to be eliminated in equal cuts over ten years. Therefore, the FTA presents a significant opportunity for U.S. companies interested in exporting building products to Colombia.</p>

<p>Growth in 2014 will be based on two main drivers: offering attractive products and achieving greater market coverage. The outlook for the residential/commercial construction industry for 2014 remains positive.</p>

<p>In nonresidential construction, a favorable outlook is expected for the building of warehouses, offices and hotels. According to the Colombian Chamber of Construction-Camacol, the GDP construction/building industry forecast for 2014 could reach 8.4 percent.</p>

<p>For architectural firms, the best way to enter the Colombian market is through joint ventures with Colombian firms. For this a U.S. firm needs to have added value that will make it interesting for Colombian firms to associate with them. In this aspect, the LEED certification is a plus.</p>

<p>The market at this time is somewhat saturated due to the significant number of local firms in the market. Therefore, in order to be competitive a U.S. firm must be price competitive as compared to what domestic firms are offering.</p>
