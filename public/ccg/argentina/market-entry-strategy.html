        <p>• Marketing U.S. products and services in Argentina requires a high level of research, preparation, and involvement.</p>

<p>• Companies intending to export to Argentina need to ensure that their customers fulfill all import requirements. They should contact the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina for advice.</p>

<p>• U.S. companies exporting to Argentina typically market their products and services through Argentine agents, representatives and distributors.</p>

<p>• Close personal relationships are important.</p>

<p>• U.S. companies must consider Argentina’s unique economic, demographic, and cultural characteristics that distinguish it from other Latin American countries.</p>

<p>• It is increasingly difficult to establish a "typical customer" due to new consumption habits and to the dynamics of income distribution and demography.</p>

<p>• An important component of the marketing mix is promotion. Companies are encouraged to visit or exhibit at local and regional trade shows, and to visit trade shows in the United States attended by Argentine buyers.</p>

<p>• Protect your intellectual property and engage qualified local professionals and lawyers in contract negotiations.</p>

<p>The U.S. Embassy Commercial Service in Argentina provides a wide range of services to help U.S. companies enter and expand operations in the country. For details on the services offered, see: <a href="http://export.gov/argentina/servicesforu.s.companies/index.asp">http://export.gov/argentina/servicesforu.s.companies/index.asp</a>.</p>
