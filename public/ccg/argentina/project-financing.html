        <p>Argentina is currently unable to access international capital markets due to the legal challenges from holders of untendered defaulted debt (the so-called "holdout" bondholders who did not participate in the government's 2005 debt exchange), a situation that has been further compounded by the negative impact of the international economic crisis. As a result, financing options ― both domestic and international ― are scarce and costly in Argentina.</p>

<p>External lines of credit continue to be cut off, and new money entering the local market is primarily used to finance Argentine export transactions. Local banks have stressed that the supplier-importer relationship is key, and that the vast majority of financing options have been reduced to financing offered by the foreign supplier. Nevertheless, there may be some options available to support trade finance for U.S. exports to Argentina, as detailed below.</p>
