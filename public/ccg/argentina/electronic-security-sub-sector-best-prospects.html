        <p>Hi-tech imports play a significant role in the overall security market, as domestic manufacturing consists primarily of basic security equipment and safety supplies. Therefore, the hi-tech security equipment market presents more opportunities for U.S. companies with major opportunities in niche areas such as CCTV, access control equipment on IP networks, and safety and security design consulting services for large buildings and other real estate developments.</p>

<p>Best sales prospects for U.S. electronic security firms include:</p>

<p>• Intelligent Surveillance Systems: smart cameras and intelligent software for identification of pedestrians; CCTV on IP networks-industry specific security systems; equipment parts and software for automotive, banking, airports, ports, warehouses, mines, highways, utilities, hospitals, and construction sites</p>
