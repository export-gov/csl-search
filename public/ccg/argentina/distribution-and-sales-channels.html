<p>90 percent of the Argentine population is concentrated in urban areas, with over 40 percent living in Buenos Aires and its suburbs, and approximately another 30 percent in the cities of Cordoba, Rosario, and Mendoza combined.</p>

<p>Channel selection should be based on the nature of the product and the company's knowledge of the Argentine market. Generally, firms new to this market find it more effective to sell through a distributor. Large firms generally buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms prefer to buy through intermediaries. Industrial equipment is sold by sales agents or through trade fairs, while consumer goods are increasingly sold through large outlets such as supermarkets. Argentine distribution channels have gained increased efficiency through merging and streamlining as a result of the increased competition and changes in the consumer buying process.</p>
