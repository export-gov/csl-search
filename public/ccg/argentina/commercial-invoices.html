        <p>Commercial invoices must be presented in Spanish (one original and three copies), with the caption "Original Invoice." Carbon copies, printed copies, or photocopied invoices will not be accepted in place of the original. In addition, a properly authorized member of the firm must provide an original signature in ink on each copy of the invoice presented (i.e., the original and three copies).</p>

<p>The invoice should contain:</p>

<p>• Invoice number</p>

<p>• Place and date of execution</p>

<p>• Full name and address of the exporter</p>

<p>• Full name and address of consignee and name and address of the agent (freight forwarder), if any
• Quantity, indicating measuring units invoiced</p>

<p>• Name and description of goods (in Spanish)</p>

<p>• Unit price and total</p>

<p>• Currency used in transaction</p>

<p>• Terms of payment and delivery, using INCOTERMS</p>

<p>• Origin and place/port of export of the merchandise</p>

<p>• Means of transport (specifying via ocean or air or parcel post)</p>

<p>• Port or place of entry into Argentina</p>

<p>If the invoice is in English, the common practice is to show the Spanish translation just below the English text.</p>

<p>The invoice must contain the following declaration in Spanish:</p>

<p><em>"DECLARO BAJO JURAMENTO QUE LOS PRECIOS CONSIGNADOS EN ESTA FACTURA COMERCIAL SON LOS REALMENTE PAGADOS O A PAGARSE, Y QUE NO EXISTE CONVENIO ALGUNO QUE PERMITA SU ALTERACION, Y QUE TODOS LOS DATOS REFERENTES A LA CALIDAD, CANTIDAD, VALOR, PRECIOS, ETC., Y DESCRIPCION DE LA MERCADERIA CONCUERDAN EN TODAS SUS PARTES CON LO DECLARADO EN LA CORRESPONDIENTE SHIPPER'S EXPORT DECLARATION."</em></p>

<p>(<em>Unofficial Translation</em>: "I swear under oath that the prices on this commercial invoice are those really paid or to be paid, and that no agreement exists that permits their modification, and that all data pertaining to quality, quantity, value, prices, etc., and description of the merchandise agree in all their parts with what was declared in the corresponding Shipper's Export Declaration.")</p>

<p>A fax of the commercial invoice may be used as a working copy for customs, but the original must be presented in order to complete entry.</p>
