        <p>The Argentine currency is the peso and is signified by the same symbol ($) as the U.S. dollar. ATM machines are widely available in Buenos Aires, allowing travelers with a variety of credit or debit cards to withdraw funds automatically in local currency. Although usually accepted at most hotels, traveler’s checks are often refused by business establishments and can be difficult or expensive to change at banks. Note that you will be able to obtain pesos only at ATMs, due to currency controls.</p>

<p>Visitors should be cautious of strangers offering to exchange currency. This black market (often referred to as the “blue” or “azul” market) is illegal and participants could be subject to arrest and prosecution. Participants may also open themselves to attack by criminal elements.</p>
