        <p><strong>Data Limitations</strong></p>

<p>Investment from and to some economies, including but not limited to the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, and Macau, may mask the ultimate source/destination of the investment. Some analysts have noted that investment from and to Taiwan may be underreported.</p>

<p>Chinese FDI data do not include much of the high dollar-value minority equity stakes that American financial services firms have taken in major Chinese lenders. In addition, China does not classify reinvested locally-generated profits as new investment.</p>

<p><strong>FDI as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product</strong></p>

<p>According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, China's FDI stock equaled 10 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010; China's FDI inflows equaled 2 percent of GDP.</p>
