        <p>Franchising shows promise in China. Statistics from China Chainstore &amp; Franchise Association (CCFA) show that enterprises from more than 70 industries have applied for franchise operations, including enterprises from the traditional sectors of catering, retailing, and individual and business services. Currently, China has 4,500 franchises and chain store companies creating over 5 million jobs nationwide.</p>

<p>Challenges to U.S. franchise firms include a relatively weak regulatory system, increasing costs of labor and real estate and a lack of qualified Chinese franchisee candidates. The most recent legislation released by the Ministry of Commerce stipulates that franchise firms can start franchising in China as long as they own and operate two company-owned stores for one year in any part of the world. In addition, franchise firms must file with the local commercial authority for record within 15 days after the execution of the initial franchise contract.</p>
