        <p>China has the world's largest construction market. According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), over the next decade, China will build half of the world's new buildings and is currently adding 2 billion square meters of floor space annually.1</p>

<p>(1 Sources: Qiu Baoxing, Vice Minister of Ministry of Housing Urban and Rural Development, from China Green Building Conference and Expo, 2010.4.)</p>

<p>China is set to reduce its energy consumption and made carbon dioxide emissions a "binding goal" in its 12th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. Many provinces and cities have drafted their own enforcement plans; every city is planning to be an "eco-city" by not only retrofitting old buildings but also by building new low carbon buildings.</p>
