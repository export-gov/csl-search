        <p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>

<p>Advertising is an effective way to create product awareness among potential consumers in China. Channels for mass advertising include publications, radio, television, outdoor, online (blogs, bulletin boards, search engines), in-store and sponsorship. Advertising in China is regulated by the "Advertising Law of the People's Republic of China" (Advertising Law), which was passed in 1994. This law outlines content prohibitions and advertisers' responsibilities. Advertising should "be good for the physical and mental health of the people" as well as "conform to social, public and professional ethics and safeguard the dignity and interests of the state." Specific rules include a prohibition on the use of national symbols and government images, and prohibit advertisements that are obscene, superstitious, discriminatory and/or dangerous to social stability. The advertising industry in China is heavily regulated, and the government still exercises ultimate control over content. The Advertising Law is not completely transparent; therefore, interpretation and enforcement may be arbitrary and varied, and legislation usually favors consumer protection over business promotion. Notably, foreign businesses without a Chinese business license gained through establishing an office in China are not permitted to advertise in China.</p>

<p>The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) is the primary regulatory organization for the advertising sector, but many other organizations such as the Ministry of Culture and the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, play an active role in controlling print or television content.</p>

<p>China's retail boom and increasing competition among retailers is causing China's advertising industry to grow even faster than the economy as a whole. All of the major international advertising firms are present in China. According to the China Investment Consulting website, overall advertising revenues were $33.6 billion (142.48 RMB) in 2010. The 2011 estimated advertising revenues hit $38.3 billion. While television advertising remains the largest percentage of total expenditures, internet advertising is expected to outpace newspaper advertising by 2012.</p>

<p>Now that China is in the midst of a consumer revolution, foreign products that make use of advanced marketing, advertising and research techniques are leading the way. Brand awareness is increasingly important and sophisticated advertising is beginning to play a key role in charming the Chinese consumer.</p>

<p><strong>Trade Shows and Missions</strong></p>

<p>In 2010, approximately 5,040 trade events were held in 76 cities in China. The total number of shows, many held in smaller cities, continues to grow between 15 to 20 percent annually. Of the 5,040 shows, 837 were held in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. In general, exhibitions can be excellent venues to gauge market interest, develop leads and make sales. Most are sponsored or co-sponsored by government agencies, professional societies, or the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). Some shows are organized by American, Hong Kong or other foreign show organizers. Show participation costs are sometimes high since pricing options for available booth space for foreign companies at shows is often limited to certain areas within events. Some shows may reach only a local audience or cater primarily to Chinese exporters despite being described as Import/Export Fairs. Therefore, companies are advised to scrutinize shows carefully before confirming participation.</p>

<p>In 2012, CS in China will support U.S. Pavilions at trade shows around China in different industry sectors. The U.S. Pavilion concept is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce's initiative to promote American goods and services in key Chinese markets.</p>

<p>Updated information about these shows can be found on our website at: <a href="http://www.buyusa.gov/china/entrade_events.html">http://www.buyusa.gov/china/entrade_events.html</a>. In addition, a list of trade shows that are screened by the U.S. Department of Commerce appears in Chapter 9 of this report.
