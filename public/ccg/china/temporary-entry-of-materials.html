        <p>Although travelers will notice that Customs officials at the airports do not routinely inspect baggage upon arrival, random searches are possible. China allows an individual to import 400 cigarettes (600, if you are staying more than six months), two bottles of wine or spirits (verify current allowable quantity at the duty free shop before you purchase), and a reasonable amount of perfume. Cash amounts exceeding USD 6,000 (or equivalent in other foreign currency) should be declared.</p>

<p>Chinese law prohibits the import of cold cuts and fresh fruit. There are limits on other items, such as herbal medicine that can be taken out of the country. Rare animals and plants cannot be exported. Cultural relics, handicrafts, gold and silver ornaments, and jewelry purchased in China have to be shown to customs upon leaving China. If these items are deemed to be "cultural treasures" they will be confiscated. All bags are X-rayed.</p>

<p>It is illegal to import any printed material, film, and tapes, etc. that are "detrimental to China's political, economic, cultural, or ethical interests." As with tapes, books or DVDs that contain state secrets or are otherwise prohibited for export" can be seized on departing China.</p>
