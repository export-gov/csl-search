        <p>Sources of financial support available to U.S.-based exporters are:</p>

<p><strong>Export Credits</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), an independent agency of the U.S. Government, seeks to increase the competitive position of U.S.-based exporters in overseas markets by supporting the financing of U.S. export sales. All of Ex-Im Bank's financial products are available for Chinese buyers of U.S goods and services for the short, medium and long term. Generally speaking, Ex-Im Bank guarantees the repayment of loans or makes loans to international purchasers of U.S. goods and services. Ex-Im Bank also extends export credit insurance to overseas buyers and protects U.S. exporters against the risks of non-payment for political or commercial reasons. A reasonable assurance of repayment on every transaction financed must be provided.</p>

<p>Ex-Im Bank has signed a Framework Agreement (Agreement) with China's Ministry of Finance (MoF). According to this Agreement, the MoF will undertake to provide sovereign guarantee for imports from the U.S. for Chinese Government projects. In the past, Ex-Im Bank has worked with the Bank of China, China Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. For private sector borrowers, Ex-Im Bank will accept financial statements audited according to acceptable accounting practices with auditor's notes and statements that adequately disclose financial conditions and afford a reasonable basis for reliance on the information provided. The terms and conditions of standard export financing are governed by the OECD Arrangement on export credits.</p>

<p>For Ex-Im Bank direct loans, lending rates (commercial interest reference rates or CIRR) are set monthly and are based on a spread above U.S. Treasuries. The Ex-Im Bank is also open for limited-recourse, project financing in China. Such a project is one in which anticipated cash flows can cover debt service repayment to lenders and payment of dividends to shareholders, and is without government guarantees. Loans under this program will be available to companies operating investment projects that require imports from the United States. Project financing is also available from the various multilateral financial institutions as described below.</p>

<p>The Chinese Government and Chinese borrowers periodically receive concessional financing terms and conditions designed to support a third country's exporters. The credits can be offered under government-to-government protocols related to a particular sector or project. U.S. firms, otherwise competitive on price and quality, often lose contracts because they are unable to compete with such concessional loans. Ex-Im Bank will, under certain circumstances, consider matching the specific financing terms of a competing government offer. Tied Aid matching funds must be approved by the Board of Directors of Ex-Im Bank.</p>

Lewis, Senior Business Development Officer of Global Business Development Division, Export-Import Bank of the United States (202) 565-3716 (telephone), <a href="mailto:james.lewis@exim.gov">james.lewis@exim.gov</a> or (202) 565-3961 (fax).

The World Bank's purpose is to help borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment. China represents the World Bank's second largest commitment worldwide.

They do not enjoy a government guarantee. The IFC can be contacted through its Washington, D.C. Headquarters at (202) 473-0631 or its Beijing office, Tel: (86 10) 5860-3000, Fax: (86 10) 5860-3100.
