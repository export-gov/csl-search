        <p>In 2013, the Brazilian market for power generation, transmission, and distribution (GTD) equipment was estimated at US$ 8.9 billion (**) including US$919 million worth of imports. Of the total, US$99 million came from U.S. suppliers.</p>

<p>Electricity consumption from the grid is expected to grow at an average rate of 4.2% per year, reaching 656 TWh in 2021. Compared to previous forecasts of the Brazilian government’s Energy Expansion Plan (PDE), the electricity load on the National Grid is lower, reflecting the lower economic growth rate and the downward revision in the forecast of the industrial load expansion. By consumer type, the commercial sector shows the highest electricity consumption growth rate. Industry, in turn, reduces its share in total consumption, growing at a slower rate than the average rate.</p>

<p>According to the PDE for 2011-2021, published by Brazil’s Power Energy Research Company (EPE), the per capita electricity consumption in Brazil will increase from 2.4 MWh per inhabitant in 2011 to 3.5 MWh per inhabitant in 2020.</p>

<p>Electricity supply is expected to reach 908 TWh in 2021, growing from the current estimated 589 TWh at an average rate of 4.9%.</p>
