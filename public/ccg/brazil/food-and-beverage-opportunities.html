        <p><strong>Products not present in significant quantities, but which have good sales potential</strong></p>

<p>Health foods, especially natural and organic products, have a limited presence in the Brazilian market. Although increasing at a fast pace of 30- 35 percent per year, the local industry has not directed consistent efforts to develop this segment. There are a limited number of local suppliers offering processed organic products in the market; consequently, prices for these items are still high for the average consumer. U.S. suppliers may find great opportunities within this niche. Brazil requires the use of the organic stamp on all organic products. In order to receive approval for its use, organic producers must comply with regulations, which mean that a local certifying agent, accredited by MAPA, must assure the product is produced according to MAPA’s standards. Other food categories being sought by local importers are lactose free products, kosher products, diet products, gluten free products, baby formula, and functional foods.</p>
