        <p>The GOB has eliminated most import prohibitions with certain exceptions. In general, all used consumer goods are prohibited from being imported. Used capital goods are allowed only when there is no similar item produced locally. Aviation parts, for example, are one of the few used products allowed to enter Brazil. Remanufactured goods are still considered used goods. The country prohibits the imports of beef derived from cattle administered with growth hormones, fresh poultry meat and poultry products coming from the U.S., and color prints for the theatrical and television market. There is also specific legislation that prohibits the importation of products that the Brazilian regulatory agencies consider harmful to health, sanitation, national security interest, and the environment.</p>
