        <p>With sustained economic growth and increased availability of credit, Brazilian families have been able to plan and make longer term financial commitments, and are purchasing homes, cars, and other durable goods in higher numbers. As the lower income portion of the market becomes more sophisticated and families become more aware of the importance of quality education, opportunities for educational services will continue to grow. U.S. schools interested in recruiting in Brazil should provide creative financing options, since cost (along with proficiency in English language skills) will continue to be the biggest challenge for Brazilian students studying abroad.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the Education Ministry has been investing in “PROINFO”, a program that promotes information technology as an important teaching tool. The program provides installations of technology labs in public schools, laptops for teachers and students, digital boards, projectors and tablets. The budget will also be used to invest in classroom infrastructure and training for teachers. In 2013, the government will continue to invest in the technology program with additional purchases of tablets for teachers, computers for technology laboratories at schools and universities, smart and digital boards, projectors, and other learning technologies.</p>

<p>Brazil’s book purchasing program is also receiving increased attention. Currently, school books are purchased every three years, although the procurement process starts three years before the actual purchase. In May 2013, the Ministry of Education opened the process for book purchases for 2016; the budget allocated for 2016 school book purchases is US$800 million. The purchasing program is divided into three categories: books used in libraries, textbooks for students, and reference material books for teachers.</p>

<p>For the next decade, the fastest growing segment of the educational market in Brazil will be short term vocational courses, due to government investments in technical schools and courses for high schools students and adults. Over the past five years, demand for professional/vocational courses grew 50%. In 2011, the Government of Brazil launched “PRONATEC” (National Program for Technical Courses) and designated US$3.5 billion for the program. Since its inception, PRONATEC has funded technical and vocational courses and 2.5 million students, and expects to fund an additional 2.3 million students for 2013. It is projected that by the end of 2014, the program will fund an additional 8 million students’ courses. Those companies and educational institutions interested in participating in these programs should consider partnering with local companies or universities. The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) thru its Technical Schools SESI and SENAI is also offering the courses. Brazil recognizes the need to improve English language skills across the country. However, the majority of the population, including those employed in the tourism sector, lack basic English language skills. New government programs, both at the federal and local levels, are addressing this deficiency. For example, the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), a foundation within the Ministry of Education in Brazil whose central purpose is to coordinate efforts to improve the quality of Brazil’s faculty and staff in higher education through grant programs, recently launched a program providing scholarships for intensive English language training in the U.K. for Brazilians that are certified in teaching English. The State of Bahia is sponsoring free English classes for taxi drivers. Private English language schools throughout the larger cities are abundant.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education is in the early stages of creating a system to recognize foreign university degrees. Once the system is established, foreign universities will have to register to be included on the Ministry’s list, intended to be a fast-track system for students to have their foreign diplomas recognized.</p>

<p><strong>Education Fairs and Trade Shows</strong></p>

<p>The country’s many education fairs are one of the most efficient means to recruit Brazilian students, including the annual “EducationUSA”, supported by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). This year’s fairs will take place in late August to early September 2014. Universities interested in participating and exhibiting at the fairs should contact the Education USA office in Brazil.</p>
