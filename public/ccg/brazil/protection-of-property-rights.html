        <p>Mortgages: Brazil has a system in place for mortgage registration, but implementation is uneven and there is no standardized contract. Foreign individuals or foreign-owned companies can purchase real property in Brazil. These buyers frequently arrange alternative financing in their own countries, where rates may be more attractive. Law 9514 (1997) helped spur the mortgage industry by establishing a legal framework for a secondary market in mortgages and streamlining the foreclosure process, but the mortgage market in Brazil is still underdeveloped, and foreigners may have difficulty obtaining mortgage financing. Large U.S. real estate firms, nonetheless, are expanding their portfolios in Brazil.</p>

<p>Intellectual Property Rights: Brazil is a signatory to the GATT Uruguay Round Agreements, including the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) Agreement, which it signed in 1994. Brazil is a signatory of the Bern Convention on Artistic Property, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Convention on Plant Variety Protection, and the Paris Convention on Protection of Intellectual Property.</p>

<p>Brazil is not a party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (collectively, the "WIPO Internet Treaties"). In 2006, Brazil announced plans to join the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks ("Madrid Protocol"), but the executive branch has yet to submit this proposal to the Brazilian Congress for approval.</p>

<p>In most respects, Brazil’s 1996 Industrial Property Law (Law 9279) meets the international standards specified in the TRIPs Agreement regarding patent and trademark protection. However, the law permits the grant of a compulsory license if a patent owner has failed to locally manufacture the patented invention in Brazil within three years of patent issuance, a form of compulsory licensing that the United States believes would be inconsistent with Articles 27.1 and 28.1 of TRIPs. On May 4, 2007, invoking TRIPS provisions for public health emergencies, Brazil issued a compulsory license for an anti-retroviral drug used in treating HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>The United States continues to raise concerns regarding article 229-C of law 9279, as amended by Law 10196 (2001), which includes a requirement for the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to grant an approval prior to the issuance of a pharmaceutical patent by the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI). ANVISA has had a “prior consent” role in initially reviewing pharmaceutical patent applications before Brazil’s Patent Office, INPI (Provisional Act 2006/1999). While consolidated by Law 10196/2001, it has since been legally contested. No other industrial sector is treated in this way. For all other patent applications, INPI is the sole arbiter of whether or not a patent is granted, and other agencies regulate market access. In October 2009, the Brazilian Federal Attorney General (AGU) issued an opinion (No. 210/PGF/AE/2009) ruling against ANVISA's practice of reviewing patentability requirements. In January 2011, the AGU issued another opinion (No. 337/PGF/AE/2010) reaffirming the terms of its previous decision and noting ANVISA’s limited role. The AGU’s opinions, however, were non-binding.</p>

<p>An additional ongoing concern is the backlog of pending patent applications at INPI. INPI claims it takes an average of five years to receive a patent in Brazil; independent sources report that it takes six to seven years. INPI has increased its hiring and training of new patent examiners in an effort to decrease the backlog of pending cases. In March 2013, ANVISA held a public hearing and in April 2013, ANVISA implemented the new regulation. ANVISA continues, for now, to examine some pharmaceutical patent applications to determine if the invention described is patentable. In a February 2014 meeting, ANVISA representatives clarified ANVISA does not review all pharmaceutical patents – those determined by the Ministry of Health every two years, and most recently in December 2013. This review process may have an effect on both product availability and capital inflows for the sector and may also diminish the likelihood that newer “on patent” medications will be produced or even sold in Brazil.</p>

<p>In October 2013, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies released a report on revising patent legislation in Brazil. One recommendation is for Brazil’s Congress to approve Bill 5402/2013, first introduced in April 2013, which would reinforce the ANVISA “prior consent” mechanism. It would reaffirm ANVISA’s duty to analyze patent applications from a public health perspective, namely (1) to determine if a pharmaceutical product or process poses a health risk or (2) to determine if a pharmaceutical patent application meets the patentability requirements in cases where the processes or products are of interest to Brazil’s national health system (SUS).</p>

<p>In the U.S. Trade Representative's 2007 Special 301 Report, Brazil was downgraded from “Priority Watch List” to “Watch List,” in recognition of its improved anti-piracy enforcement efforts. Since then, Brazil has remained on the “Watch List” of the Special 301 Reports. Anti-piracy enforcement has continued to improve, especially in the major cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia. The 2014 FIFA soccer World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games are expected to continue to drive strong anti-piracy and anti-counterfeiting efforts by local, state, and federal police.</p>
