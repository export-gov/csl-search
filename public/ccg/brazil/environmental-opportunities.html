        <p>According to the Brazilian Association of Urban Cleaning Companies (ABRELPE), solid waste generation in Brazil is estimated at 62 million metric tons per year, of which about 90% is collected. About 37% of the waste ends up in garbage dumps or “controlled landfills”, both of which are highly harmful to the environment and public health. IBGE - the National Institute of Geography and Statistics indicates that only 32% of the 5,565 municipalities in Brazil have some type of selective waste collection, and that only 10% met the August 2012 deadline to present their solid waste management plan to the Environmental Ministry, imposed by the National Solid Waste Policy of 2010. According to market analysts, it is unlikely that the municipalities will comply with other legal requirements, such as replacing garbage dumps with sanitary landfills and implementing selective waste collection and recycling programs, which is currently scheduled to be met by mid-2014.</p>

<p>Despite the slow pace of municipalities complying with these recommendations, the solid waste management business in Brazil offers significant business opportunities to private sector companies. ABRELPE estimates that there are currently 200 companies in the business, and that 80% of the solid waste management services are performed by private sector companies. The market for municipal urban cleaning in Brazil is estimated at US$10.5 billion (R$21 billion), and is expected to reach US$ 22.5 billion (R$45 billion) by 2016, once law 12.305 of August 2010 is actually enforced. Industrial companies are jointly addressing policy compliance through their respective industry trade associations, which typically contract feasibility studies, design reverse logistic methods, establish waste collection points and select appropriate waste treatment technologies.</p>

<p>The industry has an interest in the implementation of incinerators, or energy generation plants, in larger metropolitan cities as well as in mid-size municipalities.</p>
